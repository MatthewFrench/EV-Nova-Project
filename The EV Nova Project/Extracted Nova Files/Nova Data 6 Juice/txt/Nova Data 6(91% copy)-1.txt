Payment is 15000 credits.                                       €As you wander around the spaceport after landing you are slightly surprised to see the same Vell-os who walked past you as you were unloading a delivery you made to Earth not so long ago."Greetings, <PN>," he begins in an almost lyrical accent.  "We have been keeping an eye on you, and it has now reached the point where I have been given no choice but to approach you.  Are you prepared to help us out?"Something in his voice, and in the way the whole area seems to stand still, tells you that this is no simple request, and you get a deep feeling of foreboding about the choices in front of you, and you hesitate for several moments before making a decision...Do you agree to help him?                                       You are surprised to feel a tap on your shoulder as you exit your ship, and you turn to see the traditional long hair of a Vell-os standing some meters away off to your right beckoning you over."Sorry to have startled you," he apologizes hurriedly, "but I do not have much time.  I am Fllyraen, and I have felt you in Llyrell's thought-forms.  You are the first non-Polaris human who has the potential to be a very powerful telepath, perhaps even a T0."Let me explain," he says, obviously aware of your confusion.  "Most humans are T6's, only peripherally aware of the power of the mind.  T5's are capable of observing and influencing the thoughts of others, T4's have the ability to produce physical force using their minds alone, such as poking someone on the shoulder to get their attention."He waggles his finger at you, and he is about to continue when out from around the side of your ship burst a group of four men and one woman, all clothed in black, carrying deadly looking blasters.                                       }When you walk into the bar a young soldier stands up and indicates that you should follow him.  You can sense that he works with the Bureau, and without thinking you obey his non-verbal command.  You are shepherded into a room that has a single spotlight facing the door."I'm sure you can appreciate the reasons behind our security precautions," begins a lovely female voice.  "It just wouldn't do for anyone to find out any more about the Bureau than they already have."As you sit, listening to her chair creak as she shifts her weight, your mind strains to make sense of the jumble of sensations in front of you.  In a sudden flash of recognition you realize that there is another, more experienced, telepath in the room confusing your senses."As far as you are concerned, I am Commander Krane," she continues.  "I want you to do something for us."                                       )The Terrapin captain's voice crackles over the comm. "Greetings, <PN>," he says.  "I've got a shipment of cargo bound for <RST>, and I'd sure feel safer if you were along with me for protection.  I'll pay you 40,000 credits to escort me to <RST> - interested?" ê After easily moving alongside, you board the derelict vessel having only a little difficulty getting through the heavily damaged airlock.  The ship's corridors are unlit, and all its systems seem to be off-line.  You reach the bridge and, when you manage to get them back on-line, the ship's own sensors reveal no life signs aboard except your own.  Suddenly your commlink beeps - your vessel's sensors have spotted several pirate vessels are entering the system!  You have fallen into a trap!                                       œYou match velocities with the derelict ship and dock with it.  Passing through the airlock you are surprised to encounter the surviving crew of the vessel, who are overjoyed at their rescue."Thank you, Captain," says their Captain, "regrettably this ship is damaged beyond repair.  If you would be so good as to transport us to <RST>, however, I have enough savings to reward you for this rescue.  Could you give us a lift?"                                       "Hi there, <PN>.  I've got <CQ> tons of <CT> for <DST>, but it's a little way off my route for my other deliveries.  Could you take it there for me?  It has to be there by <DL>, and you'll be paid 30000 credits upon delivery."                                       ("Greetings, <PN>.  I have a cargo of <CT> for <DST>, but my planned route will not take me there soon.  If you are unwilling to take it I will probably have to pay to send it by cargo-drone.  If you accept, you would be paid on delivery.  Are you interested?"                                       "Hi there, <PN>.  I've got <CQ> tons of <CT> for <DST>, but it's a little way off my route for my other deliveries.  Could you take it there for me?

I have a cargo of <CT> for <DST>, but my planned route will not take me there soon.  If you are unwilling to take it I will still be able to make it, but I will probably be very late.

The bounty for its destruction is 25000 Federation credits.                                       /"I was just recently attacked by pirates and they took most of my money, and my energy," comes a plaintive voice over the commlink.  "Can you help me out with enough energy so that I can get to the next system to deliver my cargo?  I'm prepared to pay 2000 credits."                                       yYou ask the barmaid to point out the off-duty dockmaster, and she points out a stocky fellow enjoying a quiet drink.He looks up as your shadow falls across his table.  "What can I do for you?" he asks politely.You explain your situation, saying that you were directed here to do something useful for the Rebellion that doesn't require you to have an enormous security clearance.  He looks at you and runs his hand through his graying hair.  You can sense his shrewd mind calculating the risks you pose to the security of his operation."Well, we could use some help getting foodstuffs onto the planet," he muses.  He goes on to explain, "The Bureau is trying to starve us out of the Federation, and people's belts are starting to look a little tighter."Are you willing to become a freight courier?"You realize you have no choice but to accept.                                        üJay needs you to get <CQ> tons of <CT> to <DST> in the <DSY> system and bring it back to <RST>.  Payment is 15000 credits.                                       ≤You sense Jay's shrewd intelligence and happy outlook, but decide against looking in his direction so as not to risk revealing your telepathic capabilities."Captain <PN>!" you hear yelled from the back of the bar when he finally notices you.  "Over here!"You turn towards the voice and see him sitting enjoying a drink.  He kicks out a chair at his table and indicates that you should join him with a grin."I've been told to move you up the chain," he begins smiling, "but don't get carried away," he cautions.  "It is only a small step up from food drops to equipment drops.  What it does mean is that some of the head sheds have noticed you.  If you keep this up, before long you will be up there with the best of them."Jay leans forward resting his heavily muscled arms on the table as he asks more seriously, "...that is, if you're still interested?"You realize you have no choice but to accept.                                        ûJay needs you to get <CQ> tons of <CT> to <DST> in the <DSY> system and bring it back to <RST>.

That is, until you feel him trying to gain your attention.You casually look over to see Jay waving his hand at you as he sits in his normal place.You sit down and he grins at you."If you were going to start betraying the Rebellion," he says in jest, "now would be the time you could start."You quickly probe his mind, and you sense that his comment is just an attempt at humor."The head-sheds have decided to move you up a little further," he continues quietly.  "They want you to go and pick up a Rebel informant who believes that she has been compromised.  Are you in, or do you need a little more time to prepare?"Once again, you realize you have no choice but to accept.                                       You feel a familiar tap on your shoulder and you turn to see a young soldier who informs you that you have to go to <DST> in the <DSY> system.  Commander Krane will meet you there.At the mention of her name, a nameless dread rises up in your stomach, and once again you realize the hopelessness of your situation.  As they have done so many times already in your short time of enslavement, the dark bands that enclose your mind twist you into thoughtlessly obeying the commands given to you.                                        ÇAnother rebel agent has reported in that he might have been compromised and needs extracting.                                       ÙAs you sit in the bar enjoying a quiet drink you sense the approach of a man with the distinctive mind of someone who has been recently trained as a Bureau agent.  When you look up you are startled to see a man who appears to be the rebel agent you just brought in casually walk into the bar.  You quickly realize that he is just a Bureau agent surgically modified to look like the person you captured.  He spots you and comes over."You are <PN>, Captain of the <PSN>?" he asks and you nod slowly.  "I believe that you are supposed to take me to <RST> in the <RSY> system.  I'm ready to go when you are."In despair you stand up, leaving the rest of your drink unfinished, and the both of you head towards your ship.                                       5You are quietly sipping your drink when you feel a tap on your shoulder.  You turn to see a pretty young lady with deep auburn hair smiling at you a little uncertainly."You are <PN>, Captain of the <PSN>?" she asks and you nod.  "Oh good!  I have heard that you are a very capable pilot.  Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Mu'Randa, and I need to get to <RST> in the <RSY> system so that I can conduct a business transaction with the Wild Geese.  I am prepared to pay you 20,000 credits for passage."Can you help me?"                                       You spot Mu'Randa's deep auburn hair almost immediately when you step into the bar.  Like most of the rest of the patrons, she looks up to check out the newcomer to the bar and she waves you over with a smile."I'm glad you showed up, Captain <PN>," she smiles happily, "as I have finished my business here and I need someone to take me to Sol, as I want to tie up a few loose ends there.  The payment will be the same as for when you brought me here.  Are you and your ship available for hire?"                                       ÿYou see a waving hand out of the corner of your eye when you walk into this establishment.  You turn to see the pretty Mu'Randa sitting at a table by herself waving you over.  Not for the first time you find yourself wondering about her unique name.  You have never heard a name quite like it, although it is strangely lyrical in an exotic way."Well, it seems that I have completed all my business here faster than expected," she informs you with a grin, "so I have a little time to myself before I have to perform my next mission.  I have always wanted to view some of the Vell-os/human sculptures that remain on <RST> in the <RSY> system."Would you be interested in ferrying me there?"                                       —As you wait in the bar sipping your drink you see a somewhat rejuvenated Mu'Randa walk in the door.  She quickly spots you, and makes her way over sporting a happy smile."I have to thank you for bringing me here," she begins sincerely, "this is a life-long dream come true.  Thank you so much."But now I must return to business," she continues more seriously.  "I need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system to make contact with a colleague of mine.  I am prepared to offer you another 20,000 credits for your troubles, and in all likelihood there will be another mission waiting for you within a few hours of our arrival."Are you willing to help me out again?" she asks hopefully.                                       éOut of the corner of your eye you catch a waving motion, and you turn to see the auburn hair and cheerful smile of Mu'Randa."How are you, Captain <PN>?" she asks happily.  "What do you think of the Polaris now that you have had a chance to look around?"You mutter a few vague comments about being very impressed about it all."Come now!" she exclaims, pretending to be cross.  "Surely you can do better than that!"You smile sheepishly and she laughs kindly."Now that you are here," she continues more seriously, "the P'aedt (the Polaris name for the scientist caste) could use the help of an independent ship captain to perform some experiments and retrieve some data for their various scientific endeavors.  We got a message a few days ago when they heard that one of us Mu'hari had been in contact with you, to ask if you would be willing to help out.  Are you?"                                       As you sit sipping your drink you see the slim, somehow bookish figure and brown hair of P'Jeena enter the bar.  You have to wave to attract his attention before he makes his way over to you."You are all freshened up?" he asks in his polite manner and you nod.  "Good.  Well then, to explain your mission, many P'aedt are searching specifically to find ways to cleanse biospheres of unwanted agents.  Seeing as we have virtually destroyed the environment of P'ar Aed in our early days, many of us feel quite passionate about it."We have recently discovered that certain compounds," he continues explaining, "which are given off by dead and dying Wraith corpses can actually absorb vast amounts of noxious chemicals, but the amounts we have are relatively small."That's where you come in," he nods in your direction.  "We need someone to go and pick up a sample so that we can continue our work while we look at ways and methods of synthesizing the material in question."Are you prepared to help us out?"                                       ≥You are sipping your second drink when you see the slim frame of P'Jeena enter the bar."Your sensor logs have caused quite a stir," he informs you after making his way over and sitting down.  "Always before the Wraith attacked every ship that they saw, and the only difference that we can see as being definitive is that you are not a Polaris pilot."More than that," he goes on with quiet excitement, "we now have concrete proof of Nil'kemorya claims that the Wraith have been folding space around their ships, in effect 'cloaking' them from sight.  We will have to take this data and examine it much more closely."Anyway," he sighs after his slightly excited outburst, "we want you to conduct a more thorough exploration of Wraith Space.  Specifically we want you to see if there are any other systems in their space that have planets in them, especially gas giants."Are you interested in helping us?"                                       ⁄You spot the bookish, and currently quite hunched figure of P'Jeena sitting in one of the far corners of the bar when you walk in.  He looks up and excitedly waves you over."Because of the data from your last mission, we have been able to learn enormous amounts about the Wraith!" he exclaims after you sit down.  "We believe that they are actually quite intelligent and form a kind of 'tribal' society of sorts.  We also believe that they communicate with each other by subtle variations of holo-level frequencies."Are you and your ship available at the moment?" he asks, as if suddenly remembering that you do not quite share his excitement at scientific advancement, and that you are more than prepared to dress down people whom you believe are acting improperly.  "We need someone to travel into Wraith space with a holo-scanner set to broadcast a specific message to the Wraith.  We want to invite them to talks with us.  Will you help us?"                                       —As you step out of your beloved <PSN> you spot a smiling and waving Mu'Randa standing about forty meters away.  You make your way over, wondering if she will have news about the Wraith."I'm glad you dropped in," she begins with a smile, "I was hoping you would check in soon, as we wanted you to do something for us."A single Wraith recently dropped into the J'fhor system," she explains, "and passed on a message to the A'j Do listening post there.  The general gist of the message was that our offer to talk was accepted, and contained a query concerning directions.  We replied, giving directions to here, and then saying that he would then be escorted by a slightly familiar vessel to Kel'ar Iy."Seeing as you are the only person with whom the Wraith have had any non-violent contact in our history," Mu'Randa continues with a grin, "we would like to know if you would be willing to help us out by escorting the Wraith from here?"                                       üAs soon as you step into the bar Mu'Randa grabs you and almost drags you in the direction of the spaceport."The talks are over," she says smiling by way of explanation.  "We need someone to escort the Wraith back to the edge of Polaris space."You comply with her insistence, but shake your head at her enthusiasm.  Before long, you find yourself joining another gathering of the Polaris leaders and the enormous Wraith.  They are concluding pleasantries as you arrive."We have agreed to cease attacking the Wraith in general," Mu'Randa explains in a whisper so as not to disrupt proceedings, "and not to react when young Wraith try to gather what they call <food/energy> from our ships.  In return the Wraith have agreed to cease attacks on our ships, and to try to keep their youngsters in line, with the proviso that, kids being kids, they will still probably try it at some stage."                                       You spot the deep auburn hair and slender figure of Mu'Randa as soon as you leave your ship, and you make your way over."Oh!  You surprised me," she jumps a little when you tap her on the shoulder.  "But I'm glad you did, I've been trying to track you down for some time."Now that Wraith space is open to exploration," she explains, her cheerful grin returning, "the P'aedt are beginning to send ships out to the nearest systems to begin researching the area.  Unfortunately, they believe in slow steady progress, which makes good scientific sense, but is not necessarily so good in terms of politics or security.  The Council and the Nil'kemorya want to know more about the further reaches of the region to see if there is anything they need to know about, in case they have to deal with it.  Because while it is wonderful that Wraith space is now open to us, we have also opened our space up to the Wraith, and we don't know if that will cause any problems."Are you interested in going on a scouting mission?"                                       As you step off your ship you catch a glimpse of deep auburn hair out of the corner of your eye and you turn to see Mu'Randa step into the bar.  As if she could somehow sense you looking, her eyes turn to meet yours and she makes her way over with a smile."I'm glad I caught you!" she exclaims, waggling her finger at you in mock anger.  "Otherwise I would have had to chase you all over the place to chat with you."The Council has decided," she informs you more seriously, "that they will send an envoy to meet with these 'Rebels', as they call themselves, as in recent years the Federation behavior has become increasingly disturbing.  If nothing else, we might be able to learn of a few places to go and find out more about what is actually going on inside the Federation hierarchy."And there are no prizes for guessing who's the new ambassador," she continues, waving her finger at you again.  "Unfortunately, this ambassador needs a lift, and she was wondering if you would be kind enough to offer her one."                                       You are somewhat surprised to see Mu'Randa wander into the bar looking fresh, because you are fairly sure that she spent most of last night exploring the Rebel station.  Once again she seems to react to your gaze and turns to meet your eyes before coming over."I want to get back to Kel'ar Iy as soon as we can," she tells you, her voice far more urgent than her smiling face would indicate.  "Last night I had a look around and everything I've seen tells me that these 'Rebels' are indeed genuine about their intentions, and about the accusations they have made about this Bureau.  If this is all true, we will have to rethink our policies towards the Federation in a hurry."So let's take our download of their library," she tells you in a slightly louder voice, "and say our farewells to our new friends."You are beginning to wonder about Mu'Randa's abilities.  She seems to not only be a consummate diplomat, but also a very capable spy.  You shake your head and follow her as she leaves the bar.                                       ÏWhen you step off your ship you are slightly surprised to see Mu'Randa standing not more than thirty meters from you chatting to a similarly sable-garbed man.  You again get that eerie feeling when both Mu'Randa and her fellow Mu'hari turn to meet your gaze as if they can somehow sense your eyes on them.  Mu'Randa grins and makes her way over."How's everything going?" she asks cheerfully.  You mutter something noncommittal to which she laughs before turning back to her companion.  "I've never met anyone quite so closed-mouthed before."This is Mu'Evlin," she continues, indicating her fellow Mu'hari.  "Mu'Evlin, this is... hmmm... we'll call you 'Ory'hara' for now."You cannot help but notice that not only Mu'Evlin, but several members of the worker caste in the area look surprised when Mu'Randa introduces you as 'Ory'hara'."Mu'Evlin needs to get to <RST> in the <RSY> system," Mu'Randa tells you without further explanation, "can you get him there?"                                       ÏAfter wandering the station for a few hours you enter the bar and after a couple of moments peering around you spot the jet-black hair and light blue eyes of Mu'Evlin sitting at a table not far from the door, wearing casual Federation-style clothes."Tell Mu'Randa that I have made contact," he says after you exchange greetings, "and that so far nobody has heard anything detrimental about this Bureau, but plenty about these Rebels.  But we will continue looking into the situation more deeply rather than relying on media reports for our intelligence."Also, pass on that in all probability," he continues quietly, "I will have to call for further Mu'hari to be brought to the Federation in the future to liaise with Mu'hari in different areas of Federation space."And finally," he finishes sincerely, "I wanted to thank you again for your help.  You are becoming known throughout Polaris space as someone that can be turned to at any time for help, Ory'hara."                                        ÀMore evidence has been uncovered by Mu'Evlin and his team, unfortunately it requires another Mu'hari to be sent to a different part of the Federation to follow it up.

It is almost as if somehow evidence is being deleted faster than we can find it and follow it up.  I need a new approach.  Interested?                                       ‚When you wake up the following morning you decide that you have never felt worse in your life.  It seems as if every muscle, sinew and bone in your body is in excruciating pain.  You decide that you have nothing to lose so you go through a series of limbering-up exercises Eamon taught you yesterday, and surprisingly enough in about a half-hour, you feel relatively okay.You walk down to the bar, where you recognize Eamon sitting at a dark table at the rear of the bar because of the intense stillness around him.  You still cannot 'read the weaves' as he calls the way he views the universe, but you know that nobody else around has the ability to control the space around them as utterly as he does."I wasn't expecting you to pick me out quite so easily," he congratulates you as you sit down.  "The speed with which you have picked up what you have is almost alarming.  I have never even heard of someone learning to discern the weaves so quickly."                                        ƒMessage to:  Ory'haraMessage from:  Mu'RandaI have set a few things in motion and I am now ready to act upon Eamon's suggestion.  Interested in helping out?                                       ÂAs you slowly walk down the ramp, practicing your weaves as you go, you sense a familiar flow coming towards you.  You look up to see the deep auburn hair and happy smile of Mu'Randa as she enters the bar."I see you've been working hard," she compliments you regarding your new abilities.  "Every time I meet you, you seem to have noticeably improved!"But that's not why I'm here," she shakes her head, losing her smile.  "We have discovered that New England is the secret headquarters for the Bureau, and, with a little digging, we have managed to verify quite a number of the claims made by the Rebels regarding the actions of the Bureau.  I will spare you the details, but it isn't pretty.  Many of the things done by the Bureau can best be described as sickening."Anyway," Mu'Randa continues, shaking off her grim mood, "we need someone to head over to the Rebels and inform them that we are prepared to open diplomatic ties with them."Interested?"                                       As you sit quietly sipping your second drink, with your new powers of observation you sense the imminent arrival of Dr. Pentecost and General Smart.  When they enter the room together, you can tell by the weaves around them that they are both very happy.  You guess that the Rebels are excited that someone has not only independently corroborated their findings, but is prepared to help them in their struggle against the Bureau.  As the two of them walk over you sense that everybody in the bar has turned their attention to you."We have spoken to the rest of the Rebel leaders," Dr. Pentecost begins formally, "and we have decided by unanimous vote to accept the Polaris offer to open diplomatic talks.""The first ambassador will be Dr. Pentecost himself," General Smart takes over, "but once he has set up our embassy, he will be replaced as he is far too valuable to our cause to be away for too long.""Well, I'm ready to leave as soon as we can.  Shall we launch?" Dr. Pentecost asks you seriously.                                       As you go through your post-flight routine, with your new powers of observation you expand your awareness out into the space around your ship and you immediately sense the familiar echoes that indicate that Mu'Randa is waiting for you outside.  When you finally finish, you head out to talk with her."I see that you are still practicing," she smiles, but you sense a cautionary note beneath her facade and you bring into being a weave indicating your curiosity.  "Those of us who have learned to at least guide our own weaves, after a period of learning, choose to control our weaves so as not to overly influence those around us."You suddenly understand that she is not here to send you on another mission, but that she is concerned about your training, and your well-being."That's right," she answers gently, "but I'm not the only one.  Many Polarans are worried that you cannot continue learning at the rate you are without at least a little guidance and help."Are you prepared to listen to some advice?"                                       cYou are surprised to sense Master Arando waiting for you as you bring your ship into dock.  The weaves around him suggest a deliberate sense of urgency.  You quickly go through your post-flight routine and head out to speak with him."It appears that a large fleet of Auroran ships is attempting to smash though our borders," he informs you quietly.  "I think that it may be beneficial for your training if you participated in the defense of our nation."Are you willing to risk your life for our people?" he asks seriously, his weaves showing his desire for you to do so.                                       ΩOnly by a sudden whiff of stillness do you sense Master Arando before you spot him as you exit your ship.  Once again you are amazed at his mastery of the space around him, as only your ability to slip between the weaves of life around you enabled you to detect his presence nearby."It appears that another large fleet of Auroran ships is attempting to prove themselves against us," he informs you quietly.  "I think that it is another good opportunity to continue your training."Are you willing once again to risk your life for our people?" he asks seriously, his weaves exactly matching those of the universe around him so as to completely mask his feelings.                                       Before you even enter the bar you can sense the tightly controlled weaves of a slightly worried Mu'Randa.  You observe her without disturbing the ebbs and flows around her, and when you sit down at her table, she looks up with surprise."How did you get so close without disturbing the weaves?" she asks, slightly startled.  You smile quietly and jump between her weaves and twist them around her."You really are Ory'hara..." she whispers in awe.  "I had heard that Master Arando had said that you had moved beyond his capability to teach, but I could hardly believe such a thing in so little time.  He is possibly the greatest warrior in our history, and for him to admit that you could master him if you chose is almost unbelievable, but now I see that he was only speaking the truth."She shakes herself for a moment, recovering."The actual reason I'm here is to ask for your help again," she tells you sheepishly.  "We need someone to help scout out Auroran space.  Interested?"                                       ΩYou twist a weave around Drengar to get his attention when you sense the approach of Mu'Sentan and a couple of Auroran warriors.  They enter the bar and make their way over to you.  Both the warriors have eagerness written into the weaves around them."They have graciously given us the location of the planet Rimerta to help guide us on our way," announces Mu'Sentan after he sits down.  "They have also given us a map of the local area to help speed our way over the initial journey."You nod wondering why Mu'Sentan needed a warrior escort to tell you this."They wanted to see the man who honored their battle brothers by using them to prove his worth as a warrior," Mu'Sentan explains after you raise a subtle weaving questioning their presence.  "They have fought the Nil'kemorya before, and they acknowledge them as perhaps the strongest warriors in the universe, but they have never seen your like, Ory'hara."                                       You sense that every warrior in this room is trying to observe you without making it obvious.  You decide to merge with the universe and cause an enormous hurricane of weaves centered on you to appear as if by chance.  You cannot help but smile at the astounded expressions all over the room.After recovering his composure Drengar shakes his head, smiling, "Stop showing off, Ory'hara," he chuckles.  You sense that every warrior in the room is rocked to their very core with your display of mastery over the universe.Not long after you sense the approach of Mu'Sentan."Well, things are getting interesting," he tells you after he sits down.  "I have learned that these 'Dechtakars' are a group of warriors that have no loyalty to any house, only to the Empire as a whole.  From what I have been able to gather from the other warriors I have talked with, they are thought of very highly by the warriors of the five houses, which surprises me given that they don't have much respect for each other."                                       As you sit sipping your drink and chatting with Drengar, you sense the imminent arrival of Mu'Sentan."I have a message for Mu'Randa," he tells you after he sits down.  "Firstly, I will be staying here for a while to learn as much as I can from the Elders of the Heraan House.  Secondly, it appears the Aurorans are launching battle-group level attacks in an attempt to distract Federation intelligence from a major attack to come soon, although the Heraan Elders are more than a little suspicious of the motives behind the Moash House setting this in motion.  They believe that the Moash Elders have some ulterior motive for it all, but, as yet, they have been able to prove nothing."He turns to Drengar, "Are you willing to stay also?  I ask because Auroran politics is something of a violent business, and I may not have the skills I need to defend myself.  Plus, of course, Techerakh noticed you earlier today and commented that you are a very talented student, and he would be honored to train with you."                                       ¯As you almost absentmindedly go through your post-flight routine, you find yourself concentrating on observing the ebbs and flows of the universe when you sense a familiar presence approaching.  You turn around to see a grinning P'Jeena coming towards you."Ory'hara!  It is good to see you again," he says, happy in his bookish way.  "I've been trying to find you for some time now."You shake his hand and invite him to sit down, asking him what was so important he has been trying to chase you down."Well," he begins quietly, "we have been going over the sensor logs from your missions to the Rebels, and we have found something that we believe needs more attention.  I was wondering if you could help us out again?"                                       You sense rather than see the long-haired Vell-os walk into the bar.  He indicates that you should follow him and you quickly get up and rush out the front door after him.  You sense someone starting a battleflow and you duck aside at the last instant and try to dance between the weaves suddenly being weaved around you.  You and your opponent dance around each other in what appears to bystanders to be a dervish of destruction and you seem to be gaining the upper hand, sliding comfortably between his weaves.  Suddenly your opponent slides in between his own weaves and you find yourself lying flat on the ground unable to breathe.You look up to see the Vell-os looking down at you smiling."You have a great deal of skill," he compliments you.  "I was forced to use my telepathic abilities to merge with the spirit of the universe for a moment.  You have learned much.  I think that you might be the one who will do what is necessary to help us into the veil.  Come, we will talk more in my private rooms."                                       0As you make your way to the bar you sense the familiar presence of P'Jeena waiting for you long before you walk in the door.  When you do enter he stands up and waves you over to his table."I'm glad you stopped by, Ory'hara," he says after you exchange greetings.  "As we find ourselves to be in a bit of a bother.  None of our analyses have helped us get any closer to solving the mystery of the Krypt.  The only thing we have been able to do is verify that what Llyrell said about the Krypt Pods being made of nanites is true.  Other than that we keep running up against dead ends."We were wondering," he continues almost pleadingly, "if you could go on another journey for us to see if we can gather some more information?  I warn you, this mission may be very dangerous."                                       <As you prepare to disembark from your ship you cannot help but smile in anticipation when you sense the bubbly presence of Mu'Randa waiting for you.  You create a subtle weave to alert her to your imminent arrival and she greets you when you walk out the hatch and waves you over."I am glad that our paths have once again crossed," she tells you with a smile, "as I wanted to show you something that the P'aedt and the Ver'ash have been working on recently."You are of course aware that the Vell-os still suffer as slaves under the brutal guidance of the Bureau," she breathes, "and we have long wanted to find a way of freeing them from their onerous burden.  Well, recently a young Ver'ash came up with a fairly reasonable theory as to how we might actually go about it."Interested?"                                       mAs you sit in the bar you sense the familiar presence of Mu'Randa approaching."Ver'Lahir and her team have duplicated your success," she tells you with a smile.  "Now we can move our operation up a notch."You can feel Mu'Randa's mind working deviously, and you raise an eyebrow in curiosity."Now that you are with us," she tells you, "we must prepare for the reintegration of humanity; we cannot stick to our isolationist policy any longer.  So we must begin preparing the way."You see, now that we can free one Vell-os," she continues explaining, "we can aid the rebels in their efforts to destroy the Bureau.  You see, without the enslaved Vell-os, the Bureau will no longer be able to put up show trials where 'supposedly free' Vell-os are meant to read the minds of the accused and make judgement on them.  In reality, they are told precisely what their judgements are going to be ahead of time by their Bureau masters.  The end result will be the discrediting of the Bureau (and hopefully its destruction) and so a more reasonable Federation government."Interested in helping out?"                                       !Upon landing you sense the bubbly Mu'Randa nearby, and as you prepare to disembark you can feel an underlying sense of urgency as she waits for you.When you finally exit your ship you casually merge with universe and bring into existence a weave which turns her head towards you.  After a moment of awed shock she makes her way over."You have become very difficult to track down," she begins reverently.  "I used to be able to sense your presence directly even from many systems away, but as your skills have increased it has become almost impossible to sense you directly at all, even from across the room.  Instead I have to track you by sensing the reactions of others to recognizing your presence, which is far more difficult."You almost wince when you are reminded of how the Polaris have come to think of you, but you keep your face and mind blank."Regardless," she says more seriously, "the reason I'm here is because I have urgent information that needs to get into the right hands.  Can I count on you?"                                       µAs you sit, sipping your second drink, you cannot help smiling when you sense the approach of not only Techerakh, but also your old travelling companions Mu'Sentan and Drengar.  When they enter the room you subtly direct their attention in your direction, and they make their way over.You greet both your friends with a warm smile and handshake before thanking Techerakh for bringing them along."I had nothing to do with it," Techerakh smiles, gently shaking his head.  "Young Drengar here sensed the disturbance you caused earlier at the docks and insisted on seeing you."You laugh and thank him anyway."Anyway, before you get too carried away reminiscing about old times," Techerakh continues more seriously, "we need your help.  We need someone to get the attention of the Dechtakar Elders on Rimerta, but because of the threat of invasion, we really can't spare any House warriors.  Can you help us?"                                       ØYou sense Du'Nakh's keen intellect approaching and you immediately stand and walk out of the bar and move to meet him on the way back to your ship."Why didn't you wait for me?" he asks, and you sense that he is mildly annoyed.You answer that you sensed him coming and decided to meet him on the way to save a little time."I apologize for ever doubting your motives," he breathes sincerely and you wave it away, telling him you didn't mind.You quickly go through your pre-flight checklist, aware of Du'Nakh's eyes widening every time you use your abilities to flick switches and push buttons without moving from your seat in the command chair.                                       -As you sit chatting with Du'Nakh you sense the business-like approach of Techerakh.  You surprise Du'Nakh by predicting the exact time the Heraan Thurokiir will enter the bar."Your abilities truly are amazing," Du'Nakh marvels after Techerakh joins the two of you.  "Not even Techerakh here, who is widely acknowledged as the greatest Auroran martial artist in history, could sense such things.""That's not terribly surprising," Techerakh explains quietly, "Ory'hara is the preeminent warrior in the universe.  {G"He" "She"} has not only defeated myself, but also Llyrell, the most talented Vell-os warrior in recent centuries, and has fought to a standstill the almost god-like intelligence that now inhabits what used to be Vell-os space in the galactic north-west."I may not be as talented as yourself," Techerakh smiles at your mild surprise, "but I'm not without my own abilities, and I am probably the most widely travelled person in the galaxy, with the possible exceptions of yourself and my Battle-Brother Archindar."                                       …After an hour of observing the Du'Nakh's movements to different parts of the arcology, he finally turns towards the bar, and his meeting with you."Sorry for taking so long Ory'hara," Du'Nakh apologizes as he sits down, "but, as you can understand, I had a number of things I had to take care of."You wave it away, telling him that you don't mind."I guess you want to know what's going on?" he asks mildly, and you nod calmly.  "The Emperor, his advisers and the three representatives of the Moash House have been sealed in the throne room which will never be opened again as long as the Auroran Empire survives.  That is their punishment for their treachery, and as they starve over the coming weeks, they will have plenty of time to think on their misdeeds."You are a little surprised at the severity of the sentence, but one look at Du'Nakh's face tells you that he has no doubts about the suitability of their punishment.                                       ˛Over the past few months you have been keeping an eye on the locations of Mu'Randa, Llyrell and P'Jeena, because you knew that once they got together the day you had been dreading was fast approaching.  A few weeks ago you felt them meet, and since then you have observed their search of the galaxy for you.As you slowly prepare to disembark, you know that they will ask you to once again face the Krypt.It seems like every head in the spaceport turns to watch you leave your ship, and more than one Polaris casts a sidelong look in the direction of the small group waiting for you before deliberately looking away.  You walk over and nod in greeting, but none of them want to break the ice."You know why we have come," states Llyrell, quietly pleading.  "But you cannot know the whole story.  We cannot evolve past the veil unless we have the Krypt-tokh to focus us, it is the way our mind is set up.  More than that, we have no desire to leave them behind."Will you help us?"                                       Throughout your trip back, you can feel the spirit of the universe calling to you.  Several times the need grows so great that only with an enormous act of will can you withstand it.  But soon, you know that it will grow too powerful, and you will cease to exist as a human being and instead will become one with the universe.During these struggles you peripherally notice the departure of the Vell-os beyond the physical realm, and with a nod of your head you say goodbye and wish them well.  With your enhanced senses you can still feel them wandering around the edges of your awareness, occasionally touching the physical plane as they learn more about their new realm.Finally you land on Mu'ar Haro, and you sense the relieved Mu'Randa waiting for you.  You know that she wants you to give her a lift to Kel'ar Iy to pass on to the Polaris leaders that their unspoken debt to the Vell-os is now paid."I will take you," you tell her before she can speak, and you almost wince at the wonder in her eyes.                                       YExactly on the hour, all the leaders of Polaris society file in with expectant expressions on their faces.  You smile inwardly, knowing that they aren't going to like your solution."The hour is up, Ory'hara," Bis Andreya reminds you politely.  "We are here to listen to your plan."You smile an empty sad smile, knowing that you are going to manipulate them into destroying their own beautiful civilization."Join me on the <PSN>," you say quietly, "there is something I want to remind you of, and it is best that you see it for yourselves."With that you get up and lead back to your ship before heading out into space on your way to <DST> in the <DSY> system, to remind them of the sacrifice of one of their historical heroes, Iusia.  With luck they will understand the significance of what you are trying to say.                                       NWhen you sense the approach of Mu'Randa, you know the time has come and you finally give in to the call of the universe and once again sink into the now comfortable union.Mu'Randa watches with awe as you sweep up her mind on one of your weaves and carry it out to where you are focusing your mind.  You know it is time to lead the Polaris into the war in which they will cease to exist as a nation.  You must decide which force you will lead, the one which will launch against the Federation, or the one which will try to smash through the Aurorans...                                       ƒOnce again you wait for Jay to try to gain your attention before looking in his direction to see Jay waving his hand as he sits in his normal place with a young slightly overweight woman next to him.You sit down and he grins at you."The guys at HQ want to move you another link up the chain," he says in earnest, "it looks like you're on your way."He gives you a wink."Realistically though," he continues sardonically, "your next step isn't any different from your last step.  But think of it as another rung passed to make it to the top.  Are you in, or do you need a little more time to settle yourself in?"With despair in your heart, you nod your acceptance.                                       çYou can sense Llyrell waiting for you long before you dock with the Kane Band.  As soon as you exit the ship you watch him weave his mind power into physical existence and feel him poke you on the shoulder.  After taking a moment to think about it you clumsily mimic his actions and poke him back.<good now you are a t4 you are a small step closer to feeling your way out of bondage but right now we have something important to discuss fllyraen has been ordered to tell you the rules so i am telling you to go and see him on wolf 359>You move to the sidewalk bench where Lyrell is sitting and sit down next to him before responding that you have received no such orders.  Suddenly you feel an enormous pressure on your mind that freezes you into your seat.<you may be powerful one day but i have my orders and you will obey them because you have no choice><now GO>                                       'As you step off your ship you see a {G"stunning" "well-presented"} blonde waving you over towards her."Good to see you again," she says and you realize you are talking to Commander Krane in person.  "Now that you have been made aware of the rules, I don't think that there is any need for me to hide my identity from you any longer."She indicates that you should sit on the park-bench next to her and you comply.  She pulls out a datapad and calls up a display of what appears to be a very detailed map of Auroran space."We have been working out the details of a long-range plan," she explains, "that involves the Aurorans.  Our preparations are nearing completion and we want to confirm that our intel on the political situation amongst our neighbors is correct.  Of course, the other reason I want you to go is because I am going to be sending you on a number of missions amongst the Aurorans, and this is an easy way for you to familiarize yourself."You're going to be taking a short jaunt into the Auroran Empire."                                       íYou see the Federation soldier who is your normal contact to Krane motion you over to his table.  He points towards the rear door, telling you to go straight through.  Mystified, you comply, and after a long gray corridor you go through a second door and you are greeted by the {G"stunning" "disgustingly attractive"} Commander Krane."Glad you came by," she grins as you walk in.  "We need someone to go down to Moash space and cause a bit of a ruckus.  You won't be on your own, but seeing as you've been down to the area you are the ideal scout for such a mission.  So you'll be leading a force of men into the area."                                       óAs soon as you land you can sense Llyrell waiting for you and quickly go through your post-flight routine before disembarking from your ship and making your way over to meet him.<it is time to show you how to travel follow me>You cannot help but feel a little excitement as he leads you to the spacedock and out onto a vacant pad where he immediately forms a protective barrier around himself, and you recognize the familiar shape of the Vell-os Dart.  As you continue to observe he shows you how to focus your mental energy into an elegant beam of pure physical power.After allowing his newly created ship to dissolve around him he guides your mind into new ways of manipulating the universe around you.  Within a few minutes you learn the basics behind twisting missile guidance systems against themselves, how to sense the physical size of ships around you as well as their intent towards you and how to reach out with your mind to learn more about the general nature about nearby systems.Finally he teaches you how to twist the space around you to create a hole through which you can enter hyperspace and travel the spaceways. µ You sense that the Federation soldier who is your normal contact to Krane is waiting for you to arrive.  He points towards the rear door, telling you to go straight through.  You nod and head down the long gray corridor to Krane's new office."Things are moving along nicely," she informs you with her {G"amazing" "breathy"} voice when walk in.  "The Federation forces are basically in complete control of Moash space.  We are ready to begin the next phase of the operation."You see," she explains quietly, "we want to subvert the entire Auroran Empire so that we can make use of its enormous resources.  But we could never do it by force alone.  We need help from within Empire so that we can at least have a little control over the events we want to instigate.  And now that we have control of Moash space and have taken the Moash elders prisoner, we are now in a position of power to bargain with the First Family in order to get them on side."It's time for you to start playing diplomat."                                       0After no more than about ten minutes of waiting in the somewhat stiff and unfriendly company of a few Federation soldiers based here, you sense one of the Moash House Elders walking towards you in between two heavily armed and alert soldiers.  They quickly spot you when they finally enter the spaceport, and then make their way over."We have talked it over," the old Moash warrior informs you, "and the Moash House has accepted the Bureau's proposal."You nod and thank him for his time, and you tell him that you will relay that information back to your superiors.  You tell him that you will return with further instructions.You nod to the soldiers around you and begin mentally preparing yourself for your journey back to <RST> to report to the terrible Commander Krane.                                        éThese passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 5000 credits.                                        éThese passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 5000 credits.                                        éThese passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 5000 credits.                                        éThese passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 5000 credits.                                        éThese passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 5000 credits.                                        éThese passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 5000 credits.                                        yThis P'aedt wants to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system and is offering 15000 credits.                                        zThis Ver'ash wants to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system and is offering 12500 credits.                                        {This Tre'pira wants to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system and is offering 10000 credits.                                        {This Kel'ariy wants to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system and is offering 25000 credits.                                        zThis Mu'hari wants to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system and is offering 20000 credits.                                        tTake <CQ> tons of <CT> to <DST> in the <DSY> system.

Mind you, that was nearly thirty years ago, but I never forgot that day.  'Tis a grand feeling being a captain of a starship, and that first landfall is something you'll never forget."You smile and admit that you have indeed just made your maiden voyage, and he slaps you on the shoulder with a wide grin."Congratulations, {G"son" "m'dear"}," he says, shaking your hand with genuine regard before stepping back and looking at you with an almost calculating look on his face.  "When I first made landfall, I remember running into a guy by the name of Gary, and he was just looking to settle down after plying the spaceways for a few decades.  In exchange for passage he showed me the ropes, and how to get started in this crazy universe of ours."Well, I guess what comes around goes around," he smiles, nodding at you, "so I guess I'll make the same offer to you.

"You have quite a reputation for combat, and I've been called in to see if you would like to make a little extra cash?"                                        ®Apparently an Auroran ship has been raiding in and around this system.

Without thinking you wave to the alk-obot for a second drink and nod a greeting to him."Well, Captain <PN>, you are a hard act to follow," he grins, "I have been trying to get in touch with you for some time now."As you know, the Guild only works in Federation space," Folstam continues, after a long pull on his drink "but the Guildmaster and his Day- and Night-masters want to open negotiations with the Aurorans to open another Chapter House.  So the Guild would like you to take a little side trip for them down to the Auroran capital."Interested?"                                       ÿYou make your way to the bar where you are greeted by the sights and sounds of over one hundred revelling warriors.Upon seeing you there is a sudden hush, and you get a warning itch on the back of your neck.  The silence drags on until one of the brutally tattooed warriors steps forward."I am Achmar," he intones proudly, "warrior of the Heraan House, currently serving my time in the armies of the Empire, and I am the brother of Druckmar who died proving your strength today.  Druckmar was a brave man, and you must be skilled to be able to best him.  He was my battle brother, but I bear you no ill will.  He has simply gone to meet his death proudly"He holds out his hand, and you shake it.  You are amazed at the strength of his grip.  The remaining warriors return to their drinks and as the mayhem resumes Achmar asks you."Tomorrow you will begin the long flight home and passing on the good news to the masters of your Guild, yes?"                                        ∫Apparently a Pirate ship has been raiding in and around this system.

For while the noise level did not drop a decibel, you are aware of the open stares of all the Heraan House warriors following your every move.You are about to order a drink when you are clapped on the shoulder by the most savagely colorful warrior you have ever seen.  His arms are covered by countless little circular tattoos and imprinted on his face is some type of stylized bird."I am Techerakh, Thurokiir of the Heraan House," he states formally.  "Achmar did break with some traditions by offering you the warriors initiation.  Normally such an offer is made by the House Elders and the House Council.  Because of this, your initiation will not be the normal trial by combat.  You present us with something of a problem, so we will give you the formal initiation.  With so many men and women wanting to join the house armies, this initiation is now impossible, but it will serve our purpose well enough.  If you decide to accept this offer I will take it upon myself to train you, <PN>,in the necessary disciplines to enable you to undergo your initiation ."He pauses seriously before asking "Is this what you want to do?"                                       )You nearly choke on your drink when a hand claps you on the shoulder as you take a sip."There you are," smiles Jack Folstam, "I've been following you for ages trying to catch you."He sits down opposite you and waves for a drink before continuing."The Day-Master wants you to go down to catch the first bounty that the Aurorans are offering to us," He grins. "It's obviously something of a test seeing as they have several outstanding matters that we know of that they could refer to us, but they are only offering us this one."Your mind wanders as he pauses momentarily.  You are beginning to be a little suspicious about the identity of this 'Day-Master'.  You quickly shake off your reverie when you notice that he is eyeing you curiously."Are you interested?"                                        ∫The Aurorans have put a 100000 credit bounty out for the capture of Kaniuhk.

That is until you look up to the second floor balcony and see a man who looks as though he has the right build to be your mark.The man notices you looking in his direction and immediately bolts out of sight.  You immediately sprint up the stairs after him only to be met by two muscular tattooed Auroran warriors bearing various types of bladed weapons barring your way.  With no other option, you decide to take these men down.  You pull out your blaster and blast their legs away.  You leap over their groaning forms and continue your pursuit.As you step onto the balcony you see a number of older Auroran warriors leaping to their feet, and baring a door through which you presume Kaniuhk has fled.                                        õApparently a Pirate ship has been raiding in and around this system.

You shrug, saying that it is necessary in this line of work. "I seem to spend all my time looking for you."You grin, waiting to here what new escapade the 'Day-Master' wants to pass along to you."The Guild wants to expand into Polaris Space," he continues smoothly, "and guess who comes highly recommended?" he finishes with a smile.You snort, thinking that perhaps there should be some other space-jock to run the Day-masters errands.Jack continues, "The Guild wants you to go on over there to find out a little more about the Polaris before we actually put together a formal proposal," he continues.  "Think you're up to it?"                                       gYou are about to order a drink when you see Jack Folstam heading your way.  You switch from one finger to two, and the alk-obot spits out two beers."Thanks," says Jack, as he slides onto the vacant stool next to you.  He sighs "I have been feeling a little parched the last couple of days; the atmosphere regulator in the Hunter has been playing up."You nod to a vacant corner booth, and the two of you head over to have a little more privacy.  "The Guild has a problem," Jack begins seriously.  "Do remember the second rule of being a Guild member?"You reply that it was something about not attacking other members."Well it has come to my attention that someone, with a few friends, has been systematically violating that rule," he continues grimly, "and I need someone to go and do something about it.

You are quietly enjoying the music of the band playing in the corner until Jack comes through the door.You sigh, take your feet off the chair and wave to get his attention."I seem to spend more time looking for you than actually doing my job," Folstam grumbles without preamble.  "I've got another mission that needs your touch."He chuckles as you roll your eyes in mock surprise."In a roundabout way the rebels have gotten in touch with me," he continues in a hushed voice, "they went to extraordinary lengths to do so and to maintain their security.  Apparently they have some information they want to pass on and the trouble they went to just to get in contact tells me that it might be serious."Interested in a courier job?"                                       ôIt comes as no surprise to you when you see Jack Folstam stride purposefully into the bar.  What does bother you is that your ever-confidant Night-Master is wearing a slightly worried frown."Am I glad I found you," he mutters.  "We've got a problem."Jack looks around and leans closer before whispering, "The Bureau is trying to shut us down, I'm just glad that I got to you before they did."You look a little skeptical."I wouldn't be visiting the Earth offices very soon," he says noting your reaction, "they got Corrin and have impounded any number of young bounty hunters since.  I hate to think of what they're doing to them now," he pales at the thought.  You have never been in a Bureau interrogation cell before, but if half the stories you have heard are true, you are pretty glad that you haven't.Jack opens his mouth, but something over your shoulder draws his attention.  You turn to see a group of Federation militia entering the bar via the back door."We leave now," he hisses urgently and you both get up to leave quietly without looking in their direction."Halt!" calls one, and you have no doubt who they mean.                                        ∑These passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 15000 credits to experience travel on a Vell-os craft.                                        ∑These passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 15000 credits to experience travel on a Vell-os craft.                                        ∑These passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 15000 credits to experience travel on a Vell-os craft.                                        ∑These passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 15000 credits to experience travel on a Vell-os craft.                                        ∑These passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 15000 credits to experience travel on a Vell-os craft.                                        ∑These passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 15000 credits to experience travel on a Vell-os craft.                                        ∑These passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 15000 credits to experience travel on a Vell-os craft.                                        ∑These passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 15000 credits to experience travel on a Vell-os craft.                                        ∑These passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 15000 credits to experience travel on a Vell-os craft.                                        ∑These passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 15000 credits to experience travel on a Vell-os craft.                                        ∑These passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 15000 credits to experience travel on a Vell-os craft.                                        ∑These passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 15000 credits to experience travel on a Vell-os craft.                                        ∑These passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 15000 credits to experience travel on a Vell-os craft.                                        ∑These passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 15000 credits to experience travel on a Vell-os craft.                                        ∑These passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 15000 credits to experience travel on a Vell-os craft.                                        ∑These passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 15000 credits to experience travel on a Vell-os craft.                                        ∑These passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 15000 credits to experience travel on a Vell-os craft.                                        ∑These passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 15000 credits to experience travel on a Vell-os craft.                                        ∑These passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system, and they are prepared to pay you 15000 credits to experience travel on a Vell-os craft.                                       ˆYou are sitting in the bar a rather fit, but fairly nondescript man walks in.  He sees you, and walks over casually."<PN>, it is good meeting you," he begins pleasantly.  "I am Frandall, and I have a somewhat dangerous mission for you.  I know this is a bit outside the regular line of work we get you to handle, but I need cargo carried at the same time as a passenger.  It will mean going through Federation space with a highly illegal cargo, and if you are scanned, then the game will be well and truly up.  The gear is THAT hot."You smile, casually reminding Frandall that illegal cargo is a constant when you are working for the rebellion, and he chuckles."This is even hotter than usual.

Chuckling to yourself at their naivete, you make your way over to her."How are things?" she asks with a radiant smile when you sit down opposite her.  You shrug your shoulders nonplussed.  "Well, I'm glad I managed to catch up with you, as I have another mission that needs your skills."I need someone to take an encrypted message pod down to the Moash elders containing instructions on what they should be doing in the coming months," she tells you in a lowered voice as she leans forward, "and right now my resources are spread a little thin throughout the galaxy, so you're it."                                       üAs soon as you walk in you spot the {G"beautiful" "blonde-haired"} Commander Krane sitting at a table trying to fend off an unwanted male suitor.  You make your way over quickly in the hope that you can discourage him enough so that Krane will forget the incident and let him live."There you are!" she exclaims smiling before turning back to the man.  "I'm sorry, but my business associate has arrived, and we must speak in private.  Could you excuse us for a moment?"The man takes one long look at you before nodding slightly sullenly and heading back to the bar to buy a drink.  Your hopes sink when you sense Krane filing the incident away to be dealt with after you leave."He's lucky you turned up when you did," she informs you icily and you laugh.  She shakes off her bad mood.  "I have another message that needs to get to the Moash.  That means you get to play courier again."

"You will observe proper procedure every time you wish to see me, understood?"You nod without thinking."Good, now down to business," she continues in a more moderate tone.  "We have recently discovered that the Polaris have an intelligence organization that has managed to infiltrate into the Federation, and possibly the Bureau for the past few years without our knowledge.  We want you to find their headquarters before returning here."                                       ≤You can sense the deceitful mind of Commander Krane waiting for you so as soon as you enter the bar you make your way over to her."Remember the problem we've got with the Mu'hari?" she asks quietly once you sit down.  You nod as the familiar feeling of depression settles over you when you realize you are about to start destroying another group of people for the Bureau.  "Well, we need to know a little more about them before we can formulate any real plan of action."Now, we've located a lady we believe to be a Mu'hari," Krane explains as she passes over a datafile containing several pictures of a slim, young-looking brunette.

"They want me to officially ask if you want a reassignment from grunt work to intel.  Apparently the guy in charge of our spook-work, Frandall, is a little impressed with you and requested you personally."The name Frandall bothers your memory somehow and you ask Jay about it."Don't ask," he says rolling his eyes.  "The guy used to be the head of the now-defunct Federation Intelligence.  It's only a code-name; I don't think that anyone, not even the other Rebel leaders, know his real name."But don't change the subject on me," he wags his finger in mock anger.  "Are you interested or do you need a little more time?"                                       "There you are," says Geoff when you enter.

Do you think you can handle it, or do you need some time to prepare?

You look up to see Geoff leading Mu'Randa towards you."Howdy," greets Geoff greets you casually.  "Well, the 'historic' meeting is ended, and you're stuck with being chauffeur again."Seriously though," he continues gravely, "as I understand it the Polaris are considering giving us a new type of scanning technology that will allow us to detect high-level holo-transmissions without carting around several hundred tons of equipment.  So what we want you to do is take Mu'Randa here back to <RST> in the <RSY> system and wait there for final word on whether they are willing to allow us to use this technology.

Your eyes keep flicking to the group of gray-cloaked men sitting at tables surrounding a man garbed in all-brown.  They seem to be acting very casually, but you keep feeling their eyes bore into you every time you even blink.  You get the feeling that these men are far more dangerous than they are trying to look.You see Mu'Randa walk in and she grins as she spots you."The Council has decided to allow you access to the technology," she confirms happily.  "Once they heard about your piloting exploits they were more than willing to hand it over to you.  They do suggest that you tell your leaders to look into their intelligence network.  They believe that you might have a leak."                                       ∞As you step once more into this establishment you notice your supervisor Geoff Daniels sitting at a table not far away waving in your direction.  You walk over and sit down after shaking hands."I'm glad you stopped by," he begins with a welcoming smile.  "I have something for you.  You'll be happy to know that it doesn't involve anything as arduous as travelling all the way to Polaris Space and back."Now that we have this new Polaris technology," he explains, "we want someone to take it out on a test run to see if it is worth our while to mass produce it to start putting it in all of our ships.  Are you interested in being the guinea pig?"                                       U"Ory-Hara!" comes the friendly voice of Geoff Daniels when you walk in.  "Over here!"You walk over to him and he pushes out a seat and invites you to sit down after shaking hands."That scanning technology has turned out to be something of a goldmine," he begins with glee.  "We now know that New England is where Bureau HQ is located.  The emissions that cause the machine to light up were, quite simply, the result of the enormous amount of high-level holo traffic going in and out of the system.  We have already dispatched someone to the planet to begin scanning the transmissions."We also found that a lot of transmissions were coming from one particular system," he continues seriously, "Nesre Secundus in fact.  That's where you come in.  Are you interested in going down there and having a look around?"                                       +As you sit quietly sipping your drink you hear a surge in the conversation at the door as a number of rebels greet one of their superiors.  You ignore it until you catch a glimpse of the man they are greeting, you recognize him as General Smart who makes his way over to you."Sorry to interrupt your relaxation," he says by way of greeting, "but Geoff Daniels is off somewhere doing whatever spooks do when they disappear.  He left a message in my hands to pass on and when I heard that you had stopped by I dropped everything to come down here to get it to you.  Are you interested in learning more about the mercenary organization that calls itself the 'Wild Geese'?{b818 "\"You raise your eyebrows at hearing General Smart mentioning your old comrades-in-arms."

"So we want to find out how prepared the Aurorans are.  If they are pretty well prepared we'll concentrate our efforts into other things, if not we'll have to give them a hand.  That's where you come in."We want you to scout out the Aurora system to see what's going on," he explains.  "We don't want you to land; the Aurorans have some tricky customs regulations that usually involve killing and maiming.  If I were you I would avoid that.  But if you could just find the system Aurora and have a look around, that would be ideal."Interested?"                                       You look over to see Geoff sitting in his usual seat.  He signals you over with a tired wave of his hand."I need to send you on another long journey I'm afraid," he says tiredly, rubbing his eyes.  "We didn't get anything conclusive from the holo-scanner except that the ships with Federation designations were real Federation ships.  Obviously there is something going on here that we need to know about.  So I want you to go to Moash in the Moash system in the hope that you will find something more useful there.  You won't be needing the holo-scanner as we've now discovered that the Aurorans don't use holo-transmissions very much at all."I hate to ask this of you," he continues apologetically, "but are you willing to do it?"                                       _Geoff walks in briskly and spots you almost immediately."There you are Ory-Hara," he greets you brusquely.  "It looks like the Bureau is going to cut off Raczak's forces using the entire Moash fleet plus most of the Bureau's forces.  If we can draw Raczak into Auroran space and keep him there we have a chance of salvaging the situation."I need you to go on a long roundabout mission," he continues diffidently.  "You'll be heading from here to New Ireland in the Tuatha system then you will go on to Heraan in the Heraan system before going to Rimerta in the Pimen system.  We need to get messages to the people at those places urgently as we are just about out of time to try and turn this Federation invasion into not only a real defeat, but also into a public relations coup against the Bureau."Are you interested?"                                       ›You see Eamon Flannigan enter the bar, just about filling the doorway with his muscular frame.  You down the rest of your drink in a single swallow before getting up and heading back to your ship with him.On the way he tells you that he will have to do most of the talking when they first land, and will continue to do the talking until he has introduced you to the House Elders.  Once that has been taken care of the Elders will then listen to whatever you have to say, not only with the weight they would give to words spoken by Flannigan, but also with the added weight of the respect they have for you."And don't think that last point is negligible," Eamon wags his finger.  "I have been following your career as closely as I can with the resources that I have, and I have mentioned you more than once to them.  They know, as I do, that you are perhaps the most widely travelled person in the galaxy, and one of the most skilled pilots around."                                        "You did well in there," says Eamon when he arrives just over an hour later.  "You were concise and to the point.  You also didn't try to gloss over the difficulties.  You have gained their respect and their thanks for your message.  That little speech he made about making sure your name is in any songs isn't an idle statement.  It is probably the highest compliment one warrior will pay to another."You raise your eyebrows in surprise."So what is your real name anyway?" he asks with a sardonic grin.  "You realize that you will have to{b818 " let me " " "}tell someone, otherwise only your code-name will be immortalized in song."You have to laugh at his attempt {b818 "at humor.  You know that the man alongside you is one of the few people in the galaxy who is aware of your real name..." "to discover your true identity.  After realizing that you have no intentions of revealing your real name he laughs alongside you."}                                       ~You see Eamon enter within thirty seconds of the hour he specified.  You wave to attract his attention and he comes over."I had to go and see some of my battle-brothers," he explains.  "Men who I hold closer to my heart than any family in this universe.  I could not have passed up the opportunity to drop in, as I do not get to meet them very often."You nod understandingly, saying that you would have done the same."Well it seems as though everything is ready," he says with a smile.  "The Bureau will fall into our trap, eh?"You smile thinly saying that you hope so."Why so glum?" he asks cheerfully.  "You have done all you can, nothing more can be expected of you, why do you look so down?"You reply that the events that are coming are too enormous to predict outcomes for.  You add that you do not like what you see if anything goes wrong.                                       ÛFrandall enters the bar with General Smart and they both make their way over to your table."We have just received the news that Raczak's Roughnecks left Spacedock V yesterday morning," says General Smart quietly.  "Things are now officially out of our control.  But we can try to channel them a little from here.""General Smart is going to lead the entire Rebel fleet in an attack on various Federation military targets in the hope that it will draw away ships from the Auroran campaign giving the Heraan House a better chance of surviving," explains Frandall in an equally hushed tone.  "Unfortunately our entire military doesn't amount to much against the might of the Federation Navy and if they are allowed to react effectively, we will be crushed," he continues grimly.  "Needless to say, this is not the desired outcome."We need someone," General Smart says gravely, "to decapitate the Bureau in order to cause a little chaos and confusion.  Are you interested?"                                       S"There you are!" exclaims Frandall after the two of you spot each other in this fairly crowded establishment.  "I was beginning to wonder when you were going to turn up."While you were away I have come up with a method to have a Vell-os trial where the Vell-os are actually capable of handing down the right decision," he explains.  "You see, because the Vell-os are enslaved and can be literally ordered to do anything, they are very useful to the Bureau in the field of justice because the Vell-os who is allegedly meant to be reading the 'truth' of statements of the accused can actually be ordered to answer a specified way.  The Bureau has used this trick for years to bias the courts.  Now since Krane's underlings are demanding her return, saying that if she has done anything wrong she should stand trial, I wanted to figure out a way of ensuring the impartiality of the Vell-os 'judge' so that she can indeed stand trial.  At the end of the day, if she is found guilty, then the Bureau will be basically defeated."Are you interested in hearing my solution?"                                       ŒGeoff walks in and you hail him from your seat in the rear of the bar.  He comes over with a grin which he loses when you address him as 'Frandall'."I survive by being unknown," he murmurs intently, "I would appreciate it if you kept the information you have quiet.  Loose lips sink ships."You nod, feeling a little hard done by, but understanding the idea.  Despite this, you cannot help but feel that he is still hiding something from you.  Something that is probably quite important."I need someone to take Krane to Sol so she can stand trial," he announces quietly.  "It should be fairly easy, but I need that person to be someone I trust implicitly.  Are you available?"                                       "If we act now," says General Smart when you two finally get to the bar, "we can end this war.  We have the Bureau running for cover, going into damage control mode.  I'm going to lead an attack on Bureau HQ on New England before returning here and sending my men out to hunt down the remnants of their forces.  The news I'm getting from Auroran space is that the Heraan House has accused the Moash House of trying to destroy their Empire.  And with Dechtakar witnesses, it looks like the charges might stick, which would mean the Moash House would be stripped of their position, lands and even their name.  The way things are going, it looks like Heraan is going to become First House, and they seem to be at least a reasonable bunch.  All in all, things are looking up."I need someone to go and pick up the other rebel leaders," he tells you quietly.  "I want to make an announcement in the press calling for general elections within the Federation, and many of them will want to stand for office.  Can you do it?"                                       You walk into the bar and see Mu'Randa and the other telepaths sitting near the door."Ory'hara, how are you?" she asks with her dazzling smile.  "I'm so glad you got my message.  Please, join us."You begin to making casual conversation as the Polaris loosen up around you.  You discuss many things from the philosophies of the differing Polaris castes to the bits and pieces you know about Federation election protocols.  You remember that you have heard nothing from Frandall and you ask them if they have seen him."I don't really want to talk about him," Mu'Randa wrinkles her nose in disgust.  "Have you heard that Commander Krane was found disembowelled in her cell?  Nobody knows who did it or how it was done, but I have my suspicions.  Did you know that he was the one who started the Rebellion?"Anyway, the reason I asked you here," she changes the subject quickly, "is because in all the excitement of the last few weeks we seem to have been forgotten and we need a lift home.

He laughs and pokes you in the shoulder with his telekinetic 'finger'."Well watch closely," he says aloud, "and I will show you how..."You sit down, preparing to follow Fllyraen's mind when suddenly your mind is filled with images of him weaving a javelin into existence around himself.  After a few moments of surprise, you adjust to the different method of teaching and begin following Fllyraen's steps weave by weave until you have created a javelin of your own. ëAs soon as you land you can sense the foreign thought patterns of a Mu'hari from across the globe.

Please, join me."You realize as you begin chatting that you are talking to one of your few friends in the galaxy.  You ask what she is doing in Federation space and she tells you that the Polaris wanted someone to witness the passing of the Vell-os out of this universe.You remember that you have heard nothing from Frandall and you ask her if she has seen him."I don't really want to talk about him," Mu'Randa wrinkles her nose in disgust.

He comes over with a grin which he loses when you address him as 'Frandall'."Well it appears that I have underestimated your powers of perception," he murmurs intently, "I won't do that again."You shrug, telling him that your new skills allowed you to unravel the mystery fairly easily.  You observe him closely as you speak, noting the currents of worry and suspicion coming off him.  You realize that he is still hiding something from you.  Something that he thinks is very important."I need someone to take Krane to Sol so she can stand trial," he announces quietly.  "It should be fairly easy, but I need that person to be someone I trust implicitly.  Are you available?"                                       ¬After a good night of sleep and many hours of meditation you enter the bar feeling completely refreshed.  As soon as you enter you feel the familiar presences of Llyrell and Mu'Randa.  After getting yourself a drink you join them at their table."I must thank you for freeing my people," Llyrell tells you quietly.  "Without your skill, we would have remained slaves."You are taken aback.  You were not aware that the entire Vell-os race had yet been freed."I have taken the strain of slavery off one of my fellow Vell-os," he tells you with a small smile, "who in turn has done the same for another, and so on.  Within moments of being freed, we were a free race again.  We can now join our brothers and sisters beyond the veil, but first we want to pay our debt to you."He looks at you closely."Would you be interested in learning of a method for capturing 'Commander Krane', as the leader of the Bureau is known?"                                       ŸAs you sit in the bar recovering from your experience with the slavery device, you see Mu'Randa walk in."They have duplicated your success," she tells you tiredly.  "Ver'Lahir would have been here in person to thank you for helping them solve the problem, but she was almost too exhausted to stand, so I sent her to bed."You look up wondering what authority Mu'Randa has over the Polaris.  Looking at her you can see the wisps of commanding weaves still hanging around her."I am the leader of the Mu'Hari," she explains in response to your questioning look.  "To my everlasting shame, I have been made the leader of those who were not good enough to become members of the major castes.  The leader of the misfits."You are surprised at the feeling in her words, sensing that she really believes them.  You reach over and put your hand on her shoulder.  She looks up and smiles."You aren't here to listen to my troubles," she smiles gently.                                       !The two Nil'kemorya bodyguards accompany you to the bar.  As you wait they test you time and again by subtly weaving a flow around you and you slip through each and every one.  To any observers the three of you seem to be sitting in comfortable silence, but in reality the three of you are engaged in the most strenuous mental battle you have ever faced.  Time and time again you slip past the flows they weave.  After a while you notice that there is a converging pattern behind their attacks and you see that soon you will be overwhelmed.  You begin to despair, but then you remember the fight with the Vell-os and you feel a ray of hope.  The mental sparring continues as they tighten their net.  As the moment approaches you slow your responses as if searching for a way out.  When the final, nearly fatal weave is thrust at you by the pair you dance deliberately into the middle of it, and for the first time you make a weave of your own, swirling their weaves back on them, leaving them impaled on their own flows.                                       ÊYou walk into the bar and you see Geoff in his usual seat waving you over."I think that I may have part of the riddle figured out," he tells you after you exchange greetings.  "It revolves around some of the events that happened towards the end of the time of the old Colonial Council."Do you remember why the Vell-os left the Council?" he asks you.  You nod saying that it had something to do with the then-fledgling Polaris.  "Correct!  But to be more precise, the Vell-os left the Council in disgust after a motion calling for military action against the Polaris was passed.  Then they intervened on the side of the Polaris, destroying the Council forces intent on beating the Polaris into submission.  That, of course, led to the 'Vell-os' War.  So when the Vell-os tell you to go and talk to the people they helped before 'their' war, who might they mean."He sits back, pleased with himself."Are you interested in another jaunt into Polaris space?"                                        As you sit, finishing your second drink you see the long-haired Vell-os walk into the bar.  He indicates that you should follow him and you quickly get up and rush out the front door after him.  You sense someone starting a battleflow and you duck aside at the last instant and try to dance between the weaves suddenly being weaved around you.  You and your opponent dance around each other in what appears to bystanders to be a dervish of destruction and you seem to be gaining the upper hand, sliding comfortably between his weaves.  Suddenly your opponent slides in between his own weaves and you find yourself lying flat on the ground unable to breathe.You look up to see the Vell-os looking down at you smiling."You have a great deal of skill," he compliments you.  "I was forced to use my telepathic abilities to simulate 'Ory'hara' to defeat you.  You have learned much.  I think that you might be able to complete what you wish to do for us.  Come, we will talk in my private rooms."                                       You see Geoff and General Smart in deep conversation when you walk in.  Geoff spots you and waves you over."We have an idea on how to put the Bureau back on its heels," begins Geoff, "we are going to free the Vell-os."You look confused.  You point out that the Vell-os are not slaves any more; they serve the Federation willingly."Don't start," replies General Smart with an annoyed glance at Geoff, "we know the propaganda, this guy here was instrumental in creating it."You start having suspicious thoughts about Geoff's real identity, but you keep them to yourself for now."The Vell-os are still enslaved," Geoff explains.  "Trust me on this.  They were always far too useful to the Federation to be allowed to go off on their own tangent."                                       ;You sit quietly sipping your drink when a senior Rebel officer runs in."We've just picked up an incoming Federation fleet on long range scanners!" he shouts urgently.  "I need every ship that is fully functional airborne now, otherwise we stand no chance at all!"Good luck!"                                       0You are quietly going about your business in the Rebel II spaceport when you see General Smart run onto the main concourse."We've just picked up an incoming Federation fleet on long range scanners," he shouts urgently, "I need every combat-ready ship in the air now, otherwise we stand no chance at all."We must destroy them!" he shouts as everyone scrambles towards their ships.  "We do not have the time or the resources available at this time to evacuate.  If you fail, Rebel II is lost with all hands!"Good luck!"                                       "It has been good fighting alongside you, Ory-Hara," says Eamon as he sips his drink.  "The ancient Gaels called people like you 'warrior-poets', for they understood that to master the arts of war required a person to master their soul.  I would be honored to call you my Battle-{G"Brother" "Sister"}."Having travelled extensively throughout Auroran space and learned a little about its warrior culture, you realize that this offer is not given or received lightly.  By offering to become your Battle-{G"Brother" "Sister"} he has indicated that he holds your life to be of much greater value than his own.You are touched and bow deeply, replying that the honor would be entirely yours.  The two of you grip forearms and you both make a small incision on the back of your hands letting your blood mingle."Good luck my {G"brother" "sister"}," Eamon says by way of farewell, finishing his drink.  "If any songs are sung about these days I will make sure that your name is mentioned before that of all others."                                       ‘Many of the warriors in this room give you a small salute of respect when you enter, and you nod in acknowledgment.  You sit down to enjoy a long refreshing drink.Not more than two hours later you see Eamon walk in with a somewhat bruised-looking Raczak in tow."I think we got everything sorted out," he tells you with a slightly smug smile.  "What do you think, Raczak?""Ah... yes, I, uh, believe so," replies an uncharacteristically friendly Raczak.You chuckle to yourself when you realize that Eamon must have had a 'little chat' with Raczak about his behavior."I believe that we are ready to head back home now," continues Eamon.  "I believe that you are giving us a lift?"                                       ƒThe warriors in this crowded bar give you a respectful amount of room, but make no attempt to engage you in conversation.  So you find yourself sitting, drinking alone in this crowded bar when Eamon enters with Techerakh, the Thurokiir of this house.  The conversation falls away around you when they walk in.  They both come over and sit down."I want to thank you for what you have done," begins Techerakh.  "Without you I believe that the Heraan House would be no more."You feel the stares of the warriors around you burn into you with surprised respect."I also hear that Eamon has taken you as his 'kachi'," he continues, calling you by the Auroran word for life student.  "And I wanted to meet again the {G"man" "woman"} whom he deemed worthy of his skills and praise.  As with the last time I saw you, I find myself quietly surprised at what I see in front of me.  Both my House and I am honored to be in your debt."                                       ≈You are sitting on one of the few remaining intact bar stools drinking from a cask you found that had the top smashed off by some nameless Wild Geese soldier when you see the muscular figure of Eamon Flannigan walk in."I think that we have done about as much as is worth doing here," he comments as he sits next to you.  "I believe that it is time to talk about my payment."After a moment of thought you suggest that it might be best to go and talk to the Heraan elders before trying to rescue Raczak.  Eamon looks at you with renewed respect."I like your thinking," he nods approvingly.  "They would know a lot more about his situation than we do."You grin saying that it will give you more time to absorb Eamon's teaching.  He laughs."You might be regretting that by the time we get there," he chuckles.  "I warn you now, once I have begun training someone, I will not stop for anything.  Not even if you ask me to."                                       ÍAs you sit, sipping your drink, you see Geoff walk in. You wave to attract his attention and he comes over and sits down."Things aren't going completely according to plan," he begins wryly.  "Originally I was going to ask you to lead an expeditionary force down to Moash space, but after being told that General Smart can only spare two ships, the plan has been changed."We are going to need allies," he explains with a tired sigh, "otherwise we might as well not bother.  I'm fairly certain that {b818 "your friend" "the leader of the Wild Geese"}, Eamon Flannigan, will be interested in helping out, as he has a few very strong ties to the Heraan House."You interested in negotiating a new alliance?"                                       Geoff walks in briskly and spots you almost immediately."There you are Ory-Hara," he greets you brusquely.  "I've been getting reports from throughout our network and we are starting to build up a picture of what is going on.  It looks like the Bureau is going to launch Raczak's forces into Heraan Space to weaken them considerably.  Then they will cut them off using the Bureau's own forces while the entire Moash fleet invades Heraan space.  With one fell swoop the Bureau will have the reports it needs to inflame public opinion and the Moash House will destroy its hated enemy the Heraan House."I need someone to go down there," he continues diffidently, "to warn the Heraan military to be ready for an invasion on two fronts."Are you interested?"                                       è"Ory-Hara!" comes the friendly voice of Geoff Daniels when you walk in.  "Over here!"You walk over to him and he pushes out a seat and invites you to sit down after shaking hands."We need to know a little more about the Bureau plans," he begins explaining, "before we can figure out how best to put a spanner in the works.  The only thing we know about the Federation side of the operation is that Admiral Raczak and his men are involved.  We need someone to head down there and have a look around."That's where you come in," he tells you quietly.  "Are you interested in going on a side-trip to Nesre Secundus?"                                       ôYou look over to see Geoff sitting in his usual seat.  He signals you over with a tired wave of his hand."I need to send you on another long journey I'm afraid," he says tiredly, rubbing his eyes.  "We didn't get anything conclusive from the analysis of your flight computer except that the ships with Federation designations were real Federation ships.  Obviously there is something going on here that we need to know about.  So I want you to go to <DST> in the <DSY> system in the hope that you will find something more useful there."I hate to ask this of you," he continues apologetically, "but are you willing to do it?"                                       <"It's about time!" exclaims Geoff with a grin after you exit your ship, "I was hoping you would drop by."The two of you walk over to a nearby park bench."I've been hearing through the network that the Bureau has been operating inside Auroran space recently," he says neutrally after you both sit down.  "So naturally I want to find out exactly what is wrong.  That's where you come in."Now the Auroran Empire is a big place so I just want you to scout out the Aurora system to see if there's anything going on," he explains.  "I don't want you to land; the Aurorans have some tricky customs regulations that usually involve killing and maiming.  If I were you I would avoid that.  But if you could just find the system Aurora and have a look around, that would be ideal."Interested?"                                       úYou await for the reappearance of Mu'Randa knowing that in all likelihood the answer she will bring with her will be negative.You look up as she enters and she walks over to you and shakes her head."I'm sorry, Ory-Hara," she confirms sadly.  "The Ruling Council is not prepared at this stage to provoke the Federation into any acts of hostility.  They do however acknowledge your efforts in surviving what was a nearly impossible mission.  They suggest that you return to your leaders and tell them to look at their intelligence network as they believe that you have a rather obvious leak."I hope to meet you again under better circumstances.  Until we meet again, may you grow and flourish."You head back to your beloved <PSN>, and you have never seen her look as old and dilapidated as she does next to all these Polaris ships.  You have never felt more miserable in your life.                                       ìAs soon as you land you can sense the foreign thought patterns of a Mu'hari from across the globe.

But as soon as the hour approaches she makes her way to the bar and you can sense in her a new focus."The Mu'hari threat is too large to deal with solely from this end," she informs you quietly.  "We believe that we have located most of their network, but it would be too difficult for us to shut it down without them shutting down and going to ground.  And given the skills we have seen displayed by these Mu'hari so far, we would be hard pressed to pull in more than about half of the ones we are aware of."So we need something else for them to focus on," she tells you seriously.  "We need the Polaris to bring in as many of their resources as possible so that we can concentrate our efforts and nab as much of their network as possible in one single operation."                                       ÎYou can sense the almost arrogantly self-confident mind of Ar'Krakh moving around receiving reports and giving orders as you sit in the fairly deserted bar.  The more you study the man, the more you come to admire him.  You can sense his awesome sense of honor which he uses to guide his every decision, and you are more than a little impressed by his incredible physical capabilities.  You can even sense his dislike of his fellow Moash warriors whom he despises as dishonorable and soft.When he walks into the bar slightly more than three hours later he apologizes for being tardy, but you wave it away as being irrelevant.  He bows in response."We are ready to go," he tells you after a short bow, "all we need is your guidance."You nod and with a sinking heart remember Krane's orders to make sure that none of the Auroran ships survive the operation.  You guess that the shady Moash sent the troublesome, but effective, Ar'Krakh with exactly that in mind.                                       ◊You are forced to reach out and talk directly to the minds of the Polaris who want to hold Ar'Krakh that you wish to see him in the bar.  Within minutes he is standing before you."What is it you want?" he asks in his silky quiet voice, and you can sense the anger he feels towards you.  In response you enter his mind and show him an accelerated pace series of images detailing how you were enslaved and your life since until the moment you were able to free yourself.  When you release him he looks stunned for several moments before rising and turning to look at you."Apology accepted," he says bowing, and you smile, happy that he understood.  "I guess that I will be spending some time with these mysterious Polaris, but one day I will return to the Empire.  As of today I outright renounce the Moash House and vow to bring about its downfall."With a nod to you he turns and indicates to his gray-cloaked escorts that he is ready to go.                                       gAs you slide into one of the Kane Band's many docking bays you can sense Llyrell coming out to meet you.  As soon as you drop your protective barrier he steps forward and you clasp arms as equals for the first time.<i always knew that you were the one you have only one more step to take and i'm afraid that my orders prevent me from telling you what that is if you can make the next step then my people will have the first chance to be free in over seven centuries>You nod, understanding that he cannot tell you how to become a T0 because he cannot teach you how to reach a level which might enable you to free him."Krypt?" you ask, trying to confirm your suspicions as to who you will have to see."No," he answers, but the fact that he answered aloud and that he has completely closed off his mind gives you his real answer.                                       ÎYou can sense the Vell-os waiting for you, wondering what you have to say.<i am going to new england to start destroying the bureau> you pass on to her without preamble <no bureau personnel will be spared>She nods quietly and you can sense the filaments connecting her to the rest of her race pulsing as the information is passed along.  You bow in her direction before heading back to the spaceport to start what is going to be an eventful few days.                                       <As you wait in the bar you can sense Llyrell destroying all communications devices and sending all sensitive documents to a secure server somewhere else in Federation space.  It doesn't take him long, but he and the rest of the Vell-os quickly and efficiently disable the entire Bureau network.<we are ready now it is time to move on i need to go to korell to finish this>With a mental nod, you head to the spaceport to form your Javelin and escort Llyrell to see one of the two planets that formed the Vell-os civilization of old.                                        ¿Take <CQ> tons of <CT> to <DST> in the <DSY> system.

As you wander around the outfitting area eyeing the selection you feel a tap on your shoulder and you turn to see a young man with an officious air about him standing behind you.  He asks you if you are <PN>, Captain of the <PSN>.  When you answer yes, he tells you that you have attracted the attention of Federation port authorities as a responsible and competent trader.  He asks if you would be willing to be employed by the Federation to move cargoes to those parts of the Federation that need them?                                       \A man in a Federation uniform wearing the shoulder pips of a Commander walks up to you and identifies himself as Commander Rabin, Spacedock III's Chief Supply Officer.  He tells you that the Federation needs more war supplies along the Auroran Federation border to keep up with demand.  Are you willing to help?                                        You recognize Commander Ffierra as he walks into the outfitting area as you browse the selection.  He locates you after a quick scan of the room, wanders over and shakes your hand."Greetings again <PN>, I have another shipment for you.  Interested?"                                       cAs you enter the outfitting area you are hailed by Commander Ffierra from his seat at a side table near the back.  After he shakes your hand you both sit down."It's a good thing you dropped in," he states quietly, "because we have another load of cargo that needs moving, and the sooner we get it moved, the better."                                       When you enter the outfitting area you see Commander Rabin in a seat at a side table near the back amongst various pieces of machinery.

The Bureau can't be allowed to kill freedom of speech as well.""Shut up!" hisses one of the c-int soldiers, clubbing the politician with her blaster.You realize that you must make your choice.

Even decades later you will be incapable of even thinking about what was done to you without screaming in fear.

ÊYou ask the barmaid to point out the off-duty dockmaster, and she points out a stocky fellow enjoying a quiet drink.He looks up as your shadow falls across his table.  "What can I do for you?" he asks politely.You explain your situation, saying that you were directed here to do something useful for the Rebellion that doesn't require you to have an enormous security clearance.  He looks at you and runs his hand through his graying hair."Well, we could use some help getting foodstuffs onto the planet," he muses.  He goes on to explain, "The Bureau is trying to starve us out of the Federation, and people's belts are starting to look a little tighter."You willing to become a freight courier?"                                        üJay needs you to get <CQ> tons of <CT> to <DST> in the <DSY> system and bring it back to <RST>.

You are lead to the room which has the single spotlight facing the door.  Except that this time the spotlight is off and the normal room lights are on."There's no longer a need for that level of security," explains the blue-eyed Commander Krane in response to your unspoken question.  "And I'm glad you checked in.  I believe that I have something that is uniquely suited to your talents."You hear the familiar creaks of her chair as her weight shifts."How do you feel about going undercover with the Rebels, <PRK>?  Interested?"                                       "Captain <PN>!" you hear yelled from the back of the bar in greeting as you enter.

He kicks out a chair at his table and indicates that you should join him with a grin."I've been told to move you up the chain," he begins smiling, "but don't get carried away," he cautions, "it is only a small step up from food drops to equipment drops.  What it does mean is that some of the head sheds have noticed you.  If you keep this up, before long you will be up there with the best of them."Jay leans forward resting his heavily muscled arms on the table as he asks more seriously, "...that is, if you're still interested?"                                        üJay needs you to get <CQ> tons of <CT> to <DST> in the <DSY> system and bring it back to <RST>.

Commander Krane will meet you there.At the mention of her name you get cold sweats trying not to think about what was done to you, and the black explosive mass implanted in the side of your head starts to weigh you down.                                        ÆYour eyes mist over as you read that another rebel agent has reported in saying that he might have been compromised and needs extracting.                                        ÇAnother rebel agent has reported in that he might have been compromised and needs extracting.                                       RAs you sit in the bar enjoying a quiet drink you are startled to see a man who appears to be the rebel agent you just brought in casually walk into the bar.  You quickly realize that he is just a Bureau agent surgically modified to look like the person you captured.  He spots you and comes over."You are <PRK> <PN>, Captain of the <PSN>?" he asks and you nod slowly.  "I believe that you are supposed to take me to <RST> in the <RSY> system.  I'm ready to go when you are."You down the remnants of your drink and the both of you head towards your ship.                                       [You see a waving hand as you step into the bar and you recognize Jay sitting in his normal place with a young slightly overweight woman next to him.You sit down and he grins at you."The guys at HQ want to move you another link up the chain," he says in earnest, "it looks like you're on your way."He gives you a wink."Realistically though," he continues sardonically, "your next step isn't any different from your last step.  But think of it as another rung passed to make it to the top.  Are you in, or do you need a little more time to settle yourself in?"                                       w"Good to see you again <PRK>," begins the {G"stunning" "disgustingly attractive"} Krane brusquely.  "I have something that I think needs your delicate touch."She indicates that you should sit on the sidewalk bench beside her and you comply.  She pulls out her datapad and calls up a display of what appears to be a very detailed map of Auroran space."We have been working out the details of a long-range plan," she explains, "that involves the Aurorans.  Our preparations are nearing completion and we want to confirm that our intel on the political situation amongst our neighbors is correct.  Of course, the other reason I want you to go is because I am going to be sending you on a number of missions amongst the Aurorans, and this is an easy way for you to familiarize yourself."How do you feel about a short jaunt into the Auroran Empire?"                                       `You see the Federation soldier who is your normal contact to Krane motion you over to his table.  He points towards the rear door, telling you to go straight through.  Mystified, you comply, and after a long gray corridor you go through a second door and you are greeted by your {G"attractive" "blonde-haired"} supervisor."Glad you came by," she grins as you walk in.  "We need someone to go down to Moash space and cause a bit of a ruckus.  You won't be on your own, but seeing as you've been down to the area you are the ideal leader for such a mission.  Interested?"                                       "You walk up to the Federation soldier who is your normal contact to Krane after he motions you over to his table.

You nod and head down the long gray corridor to Krane's new office."Things are moving along nicely," she informs you with her amazing voice when walk in.  "The Federation forces are basically in complete control of Moash space.  We are ready to begin the next phase of the operation."You see," she explains quietly, "we want to subvert the entire Auroran Empire so that we can make use of its enormous resources.  But we could never do it by force alone.  We need help from within the Empire so that we can at least have a little control over the events we want to instigate.  And now that we have control of Moash space and have taken the Moash elders prisoner, we are now in a position of power to bargain with the First Family in order to get them onside."So <PRK>," she grins sweetly, "are you feeling up to being a diplomat?"                                       ÿAfter no more than about ten minutes of savoring the excellent home brew served up by one of the Federation soldiers behind the bar, you see one of the Moash House Elders walk in between two heavily armed and alert soldiers.  They spot you quickly and make their way over."We have talked it over," the old Moash warrior informs you, "and the Moash House has accepted the Bureau's proposal."You nod and thank him for his time, and you tell him that you will relay that information back to your superiors.  You tell him that you will return with further instructions.You nod to the soldiers around you and drain your drink before heading back to your beloved <PSN> to head back to <RST>.                                       „You notice that nearly all the male heads in the spaceport keep turning surreptitiously to watch something just out of sight around your bulkhead.  You casually stroll out far enough to find out what they are looking at.  You smile and shake your head when you see the {G"stunning" "well-presented"} Commander Krane sitting on one of the many benches that form a significant part of any Federation spaceport.  Chuckling to yourself you go over to her."How are things?" she asks with a radiant smile when you sit down beside her.  You shrug your shoulders, nonplussed.  "Well, I'm glad I managed to catch up with you, as I have another mission that needs your skills."I need someone to take an encrypted message pod down to the Moash elders containing instructions on what they should be doing in the coming months," she tells you in a lowered voice as she leans forward, "and that someone needs to be someone I trust implicitly.

You chuckle and shake your head wondering if the guy knows that she could probably have him killed right where he stands with a small twitch of her fingers.  You make your way over."There you are!" she exclaims smiling before turning back to the man.  "I'm sorry, but my business associate has arrived, and we must speak in private.  Could you excuse us for a moment?"The man takes one long look at you before nodding slightly sullenly and heading off in the direction of the spaceport bar."He's lucky you turned up when you did," she informs you icily and you laugh.  She shakes off her bad mood.  "I have another message that needs to get to the Moash.  Interested in playing courier again?"                                       ?You spot the blond hair and graceful figure of Commander Krane hurrying towards you only moments after you step off your ship.  She waves at you, telling you to wait and she hurries over.  She threads her arm through yours and escorts you into the spaceport bar and down a back hallway into an office."We have something of a situation here," she informs you as soon as you sit down.  "Apparently the Rebels have decided that because our current focus is towards the Aurorans, it is a good time for them to make a move.  Right now, we cannot afford the distraction, and I want their little attempt snuffed out before it comes to fruition.  For that I need someone who has the ability to get back into the rebellion at short notice."How do you feel about recontacting your old rebel friends?"                                       ßYou see a waving hand as you step into the bar and you recognize Jay sitting in his normal place enjoying a drink.You sit down and he grins at you."I made a few calls after I saw you earlier," he says earnestly, "and the head-sheds have decided to take advantage of your reappearance."He gives you a quick wink."I don't know a lot about the situation," he continues quietly, "but from what I hear there are officials fairly high up in the Federation government who aren't very happy about what the Bureau has been doing.  Apparently they made contact somehow and want to pass information along."Are you interested in being courier?"                                       You see 'Dorraj' walk into the bar as you sit sipping your drink.  You observe him for a long moment before waving to attract his attention.  You wonder what would drive a Federation President to take the enormous risk of contacting the Rebels.  You mentally shrug, thinking that it will prove irrelevant once you make your report to Krane."Here is the return message," he tells you pulling out a small message pod from under his coat.  "I believe that you know where to take it?"You take the pod off him and nod, noticing the quality job done on his disguise.  Without the small mistake with the color differences of the wig and the mustache, you probably would not have picked it.He thanks you and walks out of the bar leaving you thinking.                                       ÃYou see Captain Daniels waving to attract your attention as soon as you walk in.  You make your way over and sit down at his table."I'm afraid that this will be the last mission we have for you," he begins almost apologetically.  "We want you to carry a message to Dorraj Rainsford again.  I'm afraid that I cannot reveal any more information about the mission than that until you have agreed to it."Are you available?"                                       9As soon as you walk in you spot your normal contact sitting in his usual seat.  He sees you and nods with his head towards the back door and you nod in thanks before heading into Krane's office."You're back!" she smiles happily.  "You had been out so long that I was starting to get a little worried about you.  What news from the Rebels?"You quickly explain the events of your recent journeys concluding with the place and time of the meeting between the President and the Rebels."Good work!" she exclaims before turning her big blue eyes on you and asking meaningfully: "So you know where at least one of the Rebel bases is?"You nod and she begins typing away at her console.  After a few moments she indicates that you should stay put before leaving the room for a few minutes.                                       ÷You are a little surprised to see the lithe figure and blond hair of Commander Krane sitting near the rear of the bar when you enter this establishment.  She waves you over with a smile."How are things?" she asks sincerely, and you shrug.  "You can be a bit hard to track down, Captain <PN>.  I've been trying to catch you for a while."We have decided that everything is ready for the final push in the Auroran operation," she leans forward and tells you in a hushed tone.  "Everything is in place, or will be within a few weeks.  Trouble is, we need someone to go and tell the Moash elders, so that they can keep up their side of the bargain."Interested in a bit more courier work?"                                       yAs soon as you walk in you spot the {G"stunning" "disgustingly attractive"} Commander Krane seated near the rear of the bar.

Now all I have to do is come here to have a chat with you."You shrug, telling her sardonically that you are glad to have been of service."And much appreciated it is too!" she exclaims after a long chuckle.  "We should employ more people like you."Anyway, let's get down to business," she continues more seriously.  "Do you remember the recent business we had with the rebels?  Well, we want to tie up a few loose ends and bring the Federation President under more direct control.  Are you interested in being the messenger?"                                       ™You are quietly chuckling to yourself as you watch footage of the former rebel leaders admitting to various crimes against the Federation when you receive a tap on the shoulder.  Turning around you see the {G"stunning" "disgustingly attractive"} Commander Krane beckoning you towards a secluded table near the rear of the bar."Frandall was, as usual, right on the money," she begins quietly.  "The Polaris have sent out a diplomatic feeler towards the Federation.  There is little doubt that they are aware of the fact that the Aurorans now pay tribute to us, and so they want to open diplomatic ties with us because we are probably too much of a threat to ignore any longer."We need someone to head over there to begin initial talks with the Polaris government," she explains, smiling.  "Are you interested in being the first non-Polaran in probably seven centuries to visit the Polaris capital?"                                       ÙAs you sit, you notice that all the people in this bar either wear brown with color coded collars or that they wear clothes of overall hue similar to the collars of those garbed in brown, the other colors being white, green, blue, gray and black.  Again you wonder what the significance is.Your thoughts are interrupted when everybody in the bar stands as the elderly figure of Bis Andreya enters.  She waves them all down with a smile and a whisper of thanks before heading over to your table."The Polaris Ruling Council has reached a decision regarding our offer to the Federation," she intones formally.  "Are your prepared to act as a courier between our peoples, and carry our proposal back to your superiors?"                                       LYou are sitting by yourself, quietly enjoying your drink when you observe Krane and Frandall enter the bar.  They both soon spot you and make their way over."It looks as though the Federation is going to agree with the Polaris proposal," Frandall begins without preamble.  "The Federation Council views it as a way of slowly getting out of our influence by sending our best and brightest off to learn the truth about the Bureau.  I've been able to stall them until I can get a preliminary analysis of what the average Polaris thinks of the proposal.""Of course," Krane winks, "that's only what we've told the politicians to allow us to get a few defense mechanisms in place while we figure out the lay of the land.  Are you interested in being the first Federation diplomat to ever enter Polaris space?"                                       ˙As you sit surrounded by your three captors feeling a little bruised, you realize that gray must denote being a member of the warrior caste.  You would hazard a guess that Brown would then denote leadership amongst the Polaris.  Your deductions are cut short when you see the lithe athletic figure of Iuso walk into the room."The Council acknowledges your story but agrees with me that you have no business on this station," she informs you almost casually.  "You are hereby told that this station is off-limits, and you are to leave and not return.  Are there any questions <SRK>?"Without waiting for your response, the three warriors guarding you pick you up and begin taking you back to your ship.  Everything you do to resist somehow gets twisted by some trick of mechanical advantage into moving you along faster.You realize that it is pointless to resist, and that you should simply get on with the rest of your mission and begin scouting around Southern Polaris Space.                                       ˜You are a little surprised to see the blond hair and athletic figure of Krane apparently just taking a rest on one of the many sidewalk benches in the spaceport.  She looks up, spots you and waves you over."It will be hitting the news in a little over a week," she informs you quietly, "that the Federation has agreed to the Polaris proposal.  The Polaris leader will be travelling to Earth to sign the documents sealing the alliance.  In something of a sign of good faith, the leader of the Polaris has asked to be brought here (with her personal bodyguards), by Federation transport.  Rather than leave it to just anybody, we want you to be the one to pick her up."Are you interested in becoming a chauffeur, <SRK>?"                                       Both Krane and Frandall are waiting for you when you walk in, and they take you down the corridor at the rear of the bar into the Bureau office there."As we told you on Earth," begins Krane as you sit down, "this has been the plan for some time.  We knew that the Polaris would have to react to our sudden takeover of the Auroran Empire, and that they would be somehow trying to reeducate us.  We infected the President with a non-lethal virus to keep him from the signing because, as you know, we have him in our pocket, and so the Vice-President, on whom we have nothing, was forced to take his place in the official party.""The Polaris will now declare war against the Federation," Frandall continues, taking over, "leaving their Southern flank wide open.  A weakness our Moash allies will make gleeful use of."We couldn't tell you this before now," explains Frandall, "because we suspect that the Polaris have a number of telepaths amongst them, and we couldn't risk information reaching them of our plans."                                       ÅAs you sit, quietly attempting to down the horrendous concoction that the locals drink, you see an elderly Auroran warrior walk into the bar.  As he makes his way over you observe that his body is covered by countless 'battle' tattoos, and, despite his age, he still carries himself as if ready to ward off any attack."I am Elder Kerachk," he informs you as he sits down opposite you, with a sly smile on his face, "and you, a Federation '<SRK>' have been sent here by Krane to show us the way into the Polaris defenses?"You tell him that the plan is for the Auroran forces to launch against the home-world of the Polaris warrior caste, and then against their battle headquarters.  You explain that the Polaris have been provoked into launching a full-scale attack on the Federation, and that they will have left their Southern border relatively unguarded.                                       zYou see a tired looking Krane standing only a few meters away after you exit your ship.  Worry at her obvious exhaustion gnaws at you as you make your way over."So how are the Aurorans going?" she asks casually after you sit down.  You give her a quick summary of the events of your mission, and she nods thoughtfully when you finish."The battle is virtually at a standstill," she informs you quietly.  "Both fleets have been virtually wiped out, and we have been forced to utilize the prototypes of an experimental ship, the RAGE Gunboat, to mop up what is left of the Polaris forces."Unfortunately," she continues wearily, "the Polaris also had a couple of ships up their sleeves, and the remaining ships are super-powerful Cruisers called Ravens.  So far they have been virtually unstoppable, and although we have had some success against them by overwhelming them with numbers, we believe that at least one has managed to slip past us and will reach the Tichel system in the next few days."We need every available ship to help out," she tells you as she runs her tired eyes, "can you lend a hand?" ;Almost exactly two hours later, you see the {G"stunning" "disgustingly attractive"} Krane walk in to the admiring gazes of every man in the room.  She quickly spots you and comes over."It appears that the President is making one final attempt to grow a spine," she tells you quietly after you exchange greetings.  "He wants to announce to the media that he is going to cut Bureau spending by as much as half, which would effectively stop us from operating as an effective force unless we were to hand over the reins of governing our newly acquired territories to the Council.  He has called me to a meeting to 'inform' me of his intentions, but I will have a few things to say about it all."You shrug your shoulders, indicating that you do not feel that the matter concerns you."Oh, but I want you to be the one to take me there," she tells you gleefully.  "Seeing your face should unsettle him, and that will give me an advantage in our exchange."Are you interested in bullying the President of the Federation?" she asks with a sly grin.                                        ¿Take <CQ> tons of <CT> to <DST> in the <DSY> system.

"It seems that you have done fairly well for yourself since we last met."You shrug your shoulders, slightly embarrassed by the praise."Anyway," she continues after sitting down, "the head office is looking to expand into the Auroran Empire which would be an enormous business coup if they could.

ÇAnother rebel agent has reported in that he might have been compromised and needs extracting.                                       ßAs you sit in the bar trying to drown your sorrows you are startled to see a man who appears to be the rebel agent you just brought in casually walk into the bar.  You quickly realize that he is just a Bureau agent surgically modified to look like the person you captured.  He spots you and comes over."You are <PN>, Captain of the <PSN>?" he asks and you nod miserably.  "I believe that you are supposed to take me to <RST> in the <RSY> system.  I'm ready to go when you are."You throw down the remnants of your drink and after a few moments of hell you slowly lever yourself to your feet and you start making your way towards your ship.                                       
As soon as you enter the trade center you are approached by a man wearing the white utility garment favored by most members of the Tre'pira."Ory'hara?" asks the worker caste member respectfully in the Polaris tongue and you nod after bowing deeply.  "I am glad to make your acquaintance, I am Tre'Nerida a logistics adviser for the Tre'pira, and I was wondering if you would be interested in talking to the Federation company 'United Shipping' regarding opening official trade ties?"                                        »A client wants us to pick up <CQ> tons of <CT> from <DST> in the <DSY> system and deliver it to <RST> in the <RSY> system by <DL>.

You see a waving hand as you step into the bar and with a sinking feeling in your heart you recognize Jay sitting in his normal place with a young slightly overweight woman next to him.You sit down and he grins at you."The guys at HQ want to move you another link up the chain," he says in earnest, "it looks like you're on your way."He gives you a wink."Realistically though," he continues sardonically, "your next step isn't any different from your last step.  But think of it as another rung passed to make it to the top.  Are you in, or do you need a little more time to settle yourself in?"                                        ÆYour eyes mist over as you read that another rebel agent has reported in saying that he might have been compromised and needs extracting.                                       ∑"I have something for you," begins the {G"stunning" "disgustingly attractive"} Krane brusquely.  "Something you are actually capable of doing."She indicates that you should sit on the sidewalk bench beside her and you comply.  She pulls out a standard message pod and hands it to you."Take this to <RST> in the <RSY> system," she tells you in a low tone, "and give it to Rear Admiral Vessair.  Simple isn't it?  Any questions?"She takes a moment to chuckle at the expression of misery on your face."Don't worry my dear little toy," she laughs.  "I'm nearly finished with you, after that I'll kill you and you won't have to worry about it any more..."                                       £"Seeing as you managed to do the last mission without screwing it up," begins the {G"stunning" "disgustingly attractive"} Krane brusquely startling you as you exit your ship, "I have another one for you."She casually pulls out a standard message pod and hands it to you."Like last time, I want you to take this to <RST> in the <RSY> system," she tells you in a low tone, "and give it to Rear Admiral Vessair.  Any questions?"She takes a moment to chuckle at the expression of misery on your face."I have only a few more things for you now," she laughs.  "Once I'm finished with you, I'll make sure you are put out of your misery."                                       "I believe that you are now in the home stretch," begins the {G"stunning" "blond haired"} Krane brusquely, once again startling you as you exit your ship, "I have another mission for you."She casually pulls out a datapad and calls up a picture of what appears to be a Polaris weapon firing."We know that the rebels have been using this weapon, and we want it off them," she tells you in a low tone.  "Now, seeing as we have nobody around who is expendable enough to be sent into Polaris space lying around, you're it.  Head over to <RST> in the <RSY> system and drop by the outfitting area there and take a few pictures of the weapon and its ammunition."Don't worry," she laughs and shrugs.  "This might be it and then I'll have you killed."                                       ÷Trying to look like you know what you are doing you head into what appears to be the ship outfitting areas of this strange station.  You get a few odd looks, but luckily nobody asks you any questions.  You walk around and take a few surreptitious snaps of a Wraith Cannon as it is being re-attached to a large Polaris vessel, and take a few quick pictures of a series of the fluorescent purple packets of energy that are called the Wraithii as they are loaded on board as well.Remaining casual you make your way back to your ship and stow away your pictures before heading out into space to try to slip through the Polaris defense net and make your way back to <RST> in the <RSY> system.                                       ∑You see a smiling Commander Krane waiting for you when you land."You have done everything we've asked of you," she tells you sincerely, but with a hard glint in her eye.  "I must admit that I didn't think that you would survive this long."Unfortunately," she continues with a mocking forlorn expression on her face, "your usefulness is nearly at an end.  However, know that even your death will further our cause.  You see we have commissioned the production of a new ship, the RAGE Gunboat thanks to the information we got from your little jaunt into Polaris space.  You are obviously a competent pilot, so you will be the first to test them under combat conditions."Well done, Captain <PN>," mocks Krane almost gleefully, "you have been invaluable in helping the Bureau gain control over all of Known Space."With that she laughs and walks away leaving you with nothing but despair and defeat for company. ¥ When you walk into the bar you are mildly surprised to see Sharon Masterton chatting with Commander Krane at a table near the rear of the establishment.  Krane notices you and waves you over."I understand that you two have been working together," states Commander Krane in a business-like tone and both you and Ms. Masterton nod.  "Well, Captain <PN>, I want you to work with her again.  She has been working closely with the Federation Navy in developing a new type of ship.  I'll let her tell you the details.""This is a simple testing mission," Sharon begins smoothly, "except that we are going to be testing the 'RAGE Gunboat' as we call it against you.  You will be paid 100000 credits for your efforts, are you interested?"                                       ªYou are not surprised to be once more greeted by P'Jeena and Ver'Lliana when you step off your ship."After watching the sensor readings we have gotten from the Wraith," P'Jeena begins in his quiet, somehow formal manner, "we discovered that they were tunnelling into hyperspace rather than wrapping hyperspace around them before moving.  The end result is that they can enter hyperspace much faster than we can."Once we realized what they were doing," continues Ver'Lliana in her exuberant fashion, "we were able to begin experimenting with growing different organs to duplicate the effect."Would you be prepared to help us out with our experiments again?"                                       As you go about your usual post-flight routine you take special care to check out your new Tunnelling organ.  It appears to be fine, and you can appreciate just how effective this little organ could be in terms of both combat and general efficiency.With a quick nod of your head you decide to conclude your business here as quickly as possible.  You need to get back to <RST> to return the information the P'aedt and Ver'ash there need to start mass farming of these organs.                                       —As you wait in the bar sipping your drink you see a somewhat rejuvenated Mu'Randa walk in the door.  She quickly spots you, and makes her way over sporting a happy smile."I have to thank you for bringing me here," she begins sincerely, "this is a life-long dream come true.  Thank you so much."But now I must return to business," she continues more seriously.  "I need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system to make contact with a colleague of mine.  I am prepared to offer you another 20,000 credits for your troubles, and in all likelihood there will be another mission waiting for you within a few hours of our arrival."Are you willing to help me out again?" she asks hopefully.                                       bAs you sit sipping your drink you see the slim, somehow bookish figure and brown hair of P'Jeena enter the bar.  You have to wave to attract his attention before he makes his way over to you."You are all freshened up?" he asks in his polite manner and you nod.  "Good.  Well then, to explain your mission, many P'aedt have become curious of reports from the Nil'kemorya over the last few years that the Wraith, a hostile race occupying the space to the North-West of our own, have begun to wink in and out of physical existence, leaving only a strange energy signature that can still be followed on radar.  We need someone to carry some scientific instruments deep into Wraith-held space to try and observe this phenomena more closely."That's where you come in," he nods in your direction.  "Are you prepared to help us out?"                                       ãYou are sipping your second drink when you see the slim frame of P'Jeena enter the bar."Your sensor logs have caused quite a stir," he informs you after making his way over and sitting down.  "Always before the Wraith attacked every ship that they saw, and the only difference that we can see as being definitive is that you are not a Polaris pilot."Anyway," he sighs, returning to relative normalcy after his slightly excited outburst, "we have already discovered a way of reproducing the 'cloaking' effect of the Wraith, and we believe that it would be of enormous use for both the Nil'kemorya and the Mu'hari."I have all the data necessary to reproduce the effect," P'Jeena tells you in his quiet way, "but I still require transportation to pass this information on to those who can turn a laboratory experiment into a practical application."Can you help me?"                                       As soon as you step off your ship you are met by P'Jeena and a woman in flowing green robes who introduces herself as Ver'Lliana."Ver'Lliana has come up with a design," P'Jeena informs you in his quiet, somehow formal manner, "that should allow us to duplicate the capabilities of the Wraith."The trouble is," he continues seriously, "with something this sensitive we need to ensure that we have absolute control over as much of the experiment as possible so that we can ensure that the results are tainted by as little outside influences as possible.  So, seeing as it was your ship that we took the original readings of the Wraith from, we were wondering if we could use your ship as the observation platform for the proceedings?"                                       Upon exiting your ship you are greeted by P'Jeena and Ver'Lliana."Ver'Lliana has come up with a new design," P'Jeena begins in his quiet, somehow formal manner, "that incredibly reduces the energy signature of folding space/time.  It should leave no trace for most sensor types to pick up.""Of course," continues Ver'Lliana in a much more animated fashion, "we have to do a series of comprehensive tests before we can start growing mass organ farms."Would you be prepared to help us out again?"                                       „As your ship drops out of warp, you see the remnants of an Association fleet.  The burnt out hulks of their vessels drift through the blackness of space.  The debris field is huge, and the size of it indicates that the enemy that attacked them pounded them to dust.  The desolation is so complete.When you finally land after looking around, you see that even the supply depot was raided.  Your irritation boils over and you make a snap decision to go and see the rebels and inform them of the situation.  In a voice made icy by rage you give orders to your bridge crew who snap to comply with an alacrity beyond even their normal excellence.  You tell Dala to set course to <RST> in the <RSY> system.                                       ïIt is some time later, as you are sitting quietly waiting for news to reach you regarding your visitor when a sudden drop and then surge in the conversation near the door draws your attention.  You look up to see Geoff leading Mu'Randa towards you."Howdy," greets Geoff greets you casually.  "Well, the 'historic' meeting is ended, and you're stuck with being chauffeur again."Seriously though," he continues gravely, "as I understand it the Polaris are considering giving us a new type of scanning technology that will allow us to detect high-level holo-transmissions without carting around several hundred tons of equipment.  So what we want you to do is take Mu'Randa here back to <RST> in the <RSY> system and wait there for final word on whether they are willing to allow us to use this technology.  If they do, while you're in Polaris space, pick it up and return here."                                       6You await for the reappearance of Mu'Randa knowing that in all likelihood the answer she will bring with her will be negative.You look up as she enters and she walks over to you with a grave expression on her face."The Council has decided to allow you access to the technology," she confirms sadly, "but only at Bis Andreya's insistence.  The Ruling Council was not prepared at this stage to provoke the Federation into any acts of hostility.  However, due to the debt that Bis Andreya feels she owes you personally, she overruled the Council.  In her words, 'the debt is now paid'."Finally," Mu'Randa continues quietly, "the Council suggests that you return to your leaders and tell them to look at their intelligence network as they believe that you have a rather obvious leak.                                       YAs you step off your ship you are slightly surprised to see General Smart, in uniform, waiting for you."Good to see you, Ory-hara," he greets you pleasantly, and you nod.  "We recently discovered information that could prove invaluable to our efforts to bring down the Bureau."You see," he explains diffidently, "it seems as though Sigma Shipyards have managed to repair and reactivate the hypergate system.  Unfortunately they did this after Donald Chick and his engineers came over to us, but we still have an excellent understanding of their security system, so if we can get inside their headquarters we should be able to steal the necessary codes to use the network."However, as per usual," he continues with a grimace, "we are a little short-staffed, and I was wondering if you were prepared to help us out?"                                       5You are casually wandering around the spaceport when you are surprised by a heavy weight crashing onto your shoulders and pain across your head, chest and arms.  Mercifully you quickly fall unconscious.You wake up some time later in an Auroran hospital where you are informed that you are merely the latest victim of the devastating Auroran Drop Bear.  You spend two weeks recuperating before discharging yourself and paying your medical bills vowing to keep a better eye out above you whenever in an Auroran port from now on.                                       You are casually wandering around the spaceport when you are surprised by a heavy weight crashing onto your shoulders and pain across your head, chest and arms.  Mercifully you quickly fall unconscious.You wake up some time later in an Auroran hospital where you are informed that you are merely the latest victim of the devastating Auroran Drop Bear."But I was using the repellent!" you exclaim, slightly annoyed.The nurse stifles a slight cough (or was it a slight laugh?) before informing you that there are a couple of strains of Drop Bear that have managed to overcome their aversion to the repellent enough to still attack lone humans.  She quickly checks your dressings and leaves the room and you think you can hear her talking and laughing with her colleagues further down the hall.You spend an embarrassing two weeks recuperating before discharging yourself and paying your medical bills vowing to keep a better eye out above you whenever in an Auroran port from now on.                                       ˛You sit down to enjoy your drink when you are overwhelmed by average looking men from all the surrounding tables."Working with the rebels were we?" asks one in a sneering tone.Before you know it you are imprisoned and turned over to the tender graces of the Bureau.What follows, you are not sure exactly for how long, maybe days, maybe months or even years, was nothing short of hell.  Even decades later you will be incapable of even thinking about what was done to you without screaming in fear.  Nothing could have prepared you; the human mind is just not designed to be capable of dealing with such things.It finally ends when they implant an explosive device in your head.  You cannot doubt its existence as you can feel the scar behind your ear, and the x-ray they bring out shows it clearly as a small, dark, egg-shaped mass.  They make it very clear; you will be working for them now......welcome <PN> to the Bureau of Internal Investigation.  Nobody ever escapes...                                       rYou are sitting down and enjoying your drink when you are somewhat surprised to see a bearded Mr. Donald Chick enter the bar.  An immediate hush falls amongst the crowd as they realize one of their leaders has just entered the room which changes to surprise when he comes directly over to your table."Greetings Ory-Hara," he grins quietly, sitting himself down opposite you.  "We have recently been granted access to some technology and I've been trying to create a simple assembly process to mass produce these items, and I was wondering if you were prepared to be a test bunny for me?"                                       vYou see a tired looking Krane standing only a few meters away after you exit your ship.  Worry at her obvious exhaustion gnaws at you as you make your way over."So how are the Aurorans going?" she asks casually after you sit down.  You give her a quick summary of the events of your mission, and she nods thoughtfully when you finish."The battle is virtually at a standstill," she informs you quietly.  "Both fleets have been virtually wiped out, and we have been forced to ramp up production for the RAGE Gunboat, so that we could rush some of them to the front lines to help mop up what is left of the Polaris forces."Unfortunately," she continues wearily, "the Polaris also had a couple of ships up their sleeves, and the remaining ships are super-powerful Cruisers called Ravens.  So far they have been virtually unstoppable, and although we have had some success through sheer weight of numbers, at least one of them has slipped past us and will reach the Tichel system in a few days."We need every available ship to help out," she tells you as she rubs her tired eyes, "can you lend a hand?"

D"This is the lifeblood of our civilization," drawls Barry as you walk around the warehouse.  "It is here that most fortunes are made, and more than a few are lost.  It's not very exciting, but it can be lucrative if you stick to it for long enough."You see," he explains in his gravelly voice, "some places have high prices for certain things, and others have low values for them.  Different places have different values.  You make money by buying low and selling high.  Sometimes you can even buy medium and sell high, or buy low and sell medium, but, obviously, the profit margins will be lower.  Over time you will start to identify trade runs."To give you a head start," he continues with a quiet dry smile, "I'll show you a couple of easy runs that should get you started, what do you say?"                                       "Okay then," Barry drawls quietly, "first of all, if you bought any medical supplies at Earth, you would sell them here.  Now obviously you would want to maximize your profits, so you always want to make a return journey that's profitable.  Now, there is nothing on Port Kane that you can sell for much of a profit on Earth, however, you can make some money by buying the lowly priced equipment here and selling it on the planet of New England in the Wolf 359 System, which is just one jump away from the Sol system."What do you say," he grins slightly mischievously," we take a trip to New England?"                                       }"Okay then," he says dismissively, "familiarize yourself with this place, and remember it.  There will be times you will want to make some quick credits, so the trade route I just showed you will be useful to you, but it certainly isn't the only one.  Also keep your eyes out for special items that are often bought and sold in various trade centers, and you'll see them listed below the bottom of the regular commodities.  To those of us who have been around for a while, they're known as 'junks'.  It's just a little lingo we use.  Some of these junks can make you a fair bit of cash in a single trade, others are just novelty items.  Keep an eye out for them, they can make you rich if you're a little lucky."Now then," he concludes with a lazy grin, "how about we head back to Earth and I can start you on some of the good stuff?  What do you think?"                                       T"As you can see from the crowd," Barry smiles, indicating the many 'old-salts' wandering around perusing the various wares on offer, "this is almost a home away from home for most ship captains.  The universe can be a harsh place, and anything that gives your ship an edge is a 'must have'."For starters," he continues, waving towards the outfits, "you should certainly consider buying a map of the local systems; knowing where you're going saves you a lot of hassles of back-tracking and stuffing around.  Other outfits that are often 'must-haves' are the battery pack and the solar panels, as you can never have enough stored energy, and when you run out of energy, your solar panels quickly become a life-saver."Many pilots," he adds, indicating some software upgrades being hawked off to your left, "also find modifying their sensor software very helpful, especially the 'Gravimetric Sensors', 'IFF Decoder' and 'Auto Recharger' upgrades.  The first allows you to gain a better picture of the size of ships around you, the second will show you whether or not surrounding ships, planets and stations are friendly towards you or not and the last means you don't have to remember to refuel, it automatically does it for you."As for the rest," he gestures dismissively, "have a look around and see what you like, and what you can afford.  Be aware that the Federation government restricts a lot of outfits, either by requiring you to buy a license to get them, or by slapping a military ban on them."Incidentally," he finishes quietly, "don't think that this list of outfits is the be-all and end-all.  Earth and the Kane Band do offer a fair range of services, but they certainly don't offer you everything.  If you're willing, I could show you another planet that offers you a fair number of different outfits.  What do you say?"                                       ôYou have barely entered the bar when you are knocked backwards by the flying body of one of the bar's patrons.  The burly individual knocks you to the ground, and as you stand to give the offensive ruffian a piece of your mind (if not a piece of your boot) you notice that the man was sent flying your way by a red bearded giant fighting on the far side of the bar.  As you watch, a number of men attack him, only to be beaten back by his prodigious strength.  A man comes at him from behind, smashing a bar stool over his head.  He staggers and begins to stumble.  His sneaky attacker begins to draw a knife, and you feel as if you should help the man before he is stabbed in the back in a cowardly attack.You quickly jump into action, smashing your fist into the other man's face.  He falls backward as your fist comes away stained with blood.  The giant shakes his head, and with a roar launches himself at the remaining ruffians.  As you watch the fight ends in a quick and brutal flurry of blows.  In a matter of seconds the floor is strewn with unconscious bodies.  The man turns to you and offers his huge hand."Thanks for your help," he says in a thick brogue.  "Can I get you a drink?"You nod your assent and he turns to a dazed looking barman and orders two drinks.  You make a mental note to not drink in Dockside bars any more, and turn your attention to the man beside you.  He stands about six and a half feet tall, and looks as if he could pull apart Leviathans with his bare hands.  He has a shock of bright red carrot colored hair, and very pale skin.  He turns to you and hands you a huge drink, as black as pitch and as thick as fresh cream.He raises his glass to you in a silent salute, and takes a long pull on his drink.  You follow suit, and are surprised by the thick bitter taste that fills your mouth.  It is at once revolting and enticing, and you don't quite know what to make of it.  You guess that you should be polite and finish it, but you don't know if you'll be able.Many hours later you and your new friend, Michaleen Houge, stagger from the bar.  The manager slams the door behind you and locks it quickly, and you get the distinct impression that he was not happy that the two loudest patrons were also the last to leave.  You head back towards the docks, when Michaleen curses loudly.  You follow his gaze as best you can, and see a heavily modified Thunderhead being locked down by the port authorities.  Michaleen shouts abuses at them in a strange tongue, but it makes no difference.  Before they leave, they give him a notice to the effect that he had outstanding storage debts, and that his ship was impounded until he pays them back."Ah, but that would have to be the life of a wild rover," he sighs wistfully, waving an unsteady hand at his locked ship. "I spent all me money on whiskies and beer, and now I've none to get me ship out of hock."He slumps down next to the ship and puts his head in his hand.  Your heart goes out to him, and you ask if there is any way that you can help him.  He explains that he has to be in New Ireland in the Tuatha system before the end of the month so he can be best man in his cousins nuptials.  He says that if you can give him a lift, you can stay for the wedding and the party after.  Apparently one is very serious, and the other involves a white dress.  You have had far too many 'pints' to figure out which is which.Do you give him a lift?                                        kYou and Michaleen are sitting in the bar, and you are considering how easy it would be to stay here and drink for the rest of your life.  You notice that Michaleen has not been to work a single day you have been here.  So far all he has done is swan about and drink in pubs.  You ask him why he doesn't seem to have to pay for anything, and he looks at you in surprise."Why, don't you know who we are here in New Ireland," he answers, slightly surprised.  "We're the Wild Geese, the best mercenary organization in the Universe.  We fight for the best pay and the best causes, and we never lose.  I'm one of the Geese, so I am more responsible for the income of New Ireland than many others here.  So tradition has it that I don't pay for grog or food, nor lodgings either.  You see, there is a good chance that I will die in the service of the New Ireland economy, so I don't pay taxes or for services.  I'll cover any debt when I die."You ask him further about the Geese, and you realize that most of the famous battles of the past have had the Geese somewhere in the field.  They have a long tradition of being the savior of their employers troops, and when the day is all but lost, and most men are ready to break, the Wild Geese find a special reserve and push on, often winning the day single-handedly.  Or at least that is the way that Michaleen tells it.  By the time he has finished his explanations, many of the other patrons have begun telling their stories.  They all involve fighting, women, and lots of drinking.  By the time you leave the bar, you have a deep wish that you'd had the fortune to be born on New Ireland, or the Sol homeland, Ireland itself.  At least then you could lay claim to this rich tradition of warriors and heroes.  You tell Michaleen, who laughs until his face hurts."Musha," he waggles a finger at you "It's talk like that that'll cause folks to not let you leave.  If you stay long enough, you'll look and think and sound so much like us, that a stranger won't know the difference.  But unfortunately, I have to get back to Sol and collect my ship.  Can you take me back?"                                       \When you regain consciousness, the area around you is covered with blood.  Some of it is pooled in places, but all of it indicates that the bodies of the fallen have been removed.  You lift your head, and you see Michaleen.  He lies slumped against the wall, in a pool of blood.  You crawl to his side, but you are too late.  He is dead.  His face is a mass of bruising, and he has been badly beaten before the end.  A note has been stuck to his chest with a dagger...----------<PN>,The only reason we did not kill you is because you were not worth the effort.  Do not bother trying to take this to the proper authorities.  They weren't too fazed with the idea of Houge dying.  You would do well to forget this ever happened.  Go about your business.  It is the healthier option.Pennant.----------A sick rage fills you.  Just recently the man before you was a living breathing person, whose very presence made you happy.  Now he has died, and the men responsible have mocked the thought of you avenging him.  You gently lift Michaleen's body and head back to your ship.                                       	OYou are sitting quietly in a corner booth in the bar, when a man walks in and walks straight up to you.  "<PN>?" he asks you in a lilting voice.  You nod, noticing that the man is very heavily armed, carrying a sawn-off shot-blaster, two heavy blaster pistols and a laser rapier."I'm Flynn Brereton.  Eamon should be along soon, as should be the others."  Others?  You wonder just what is going on, when another two men saunter towards you.  They are identical, with a shock of red hair, and are both very large.  They nod a greeting to Flynn, and sit down.  Again you notice the newcomers are heavily armed."I'm Sean O'Driscol," one of them says "This here's me brother Ryan."  The other grunts, and waves for two ales.  No sooner do the drinks arrive than a slim, athletic woman approaches.  She sits, and begins to polish a throwing dagger.  You introduce yourself, and she smiles shyly at you."I'm Tara.  Tara Collins.  I'm pleased to meet you.""Don't mind her, <PN>," says Flynn.  "I've been told that she talks more eventually, though I've known her three years meself, and nary an errant word does she say to me."  Tara shoots a wilting look at Flynn, before returning to her blade.  You are about to ask what is going on when Eamon Flannigan stalks into the bar, followed by three others."Ah, <PN>, I see you have already met the others," he begins almost brusquely.  "These with me make up the rest of the Wild Rovers.  The Rovers are the closest thing the Wild Geese have to Special Forces.  The eight people you see here are the most resourceful individuals on all New Ireland.  They are used primarily as spies, but are also capable of demolitions work, assassination, anything really.  Now, I've called them all here to outline the plan against Pennant and the Sol Sector branch of McGowan's organization."Eamon goes over the background of the situation, of how Michaleen was tasked to infiltrate the organization and assess its strengths and weaknesses; how he got into trouble when he owed the criminals a lot of money, and how the organization killed Michaleen.  The Rovers are quiet throughout the meeting, silently drinking their drinks and listening to Flannigan.  You get the impression that at any other time they would be a lot of fun, but that the current situation calls for a certain level of professionalism.                                       QYou are sitting waiting for Flannigan, and Flynn has been telling you all about his recent adventures.  You do a lot of flying, but Flynn has been from one end of the universe to the other so many times that he would have easily eclipsed your journeys.  All of his missions involve some sort of espionage, from destroying installations, to planting bugs and wires in crucial places.  You are beginning to get a grasp of how large the Wild Geese's intelligence network is, and you ask Flynn how the Geese maintain such a high level of security and awareness in what is a constantly changing galaxy."That's simple," he says, sipping his pint.  "We Geese come from a long line of usurpers.  Our ancestors fought in so many wars after being forced into exile for their political ideologies, that we have almost evolved into the unit we are now.  Where some people tell their wains about 'The Three Little Bugbears' or 'The Princess Bride', we get told stories about 'Michael Collins and the Flying Columns' or the battles of 'Rory of the Glen'.  Guerilla tactics are like mother's milk to us.  Intelligence and counter-intelligence are easy if you have been trained in them since you have been able to listen."You are still musing over this information when Flannigan arrives.  He quickly walks up to you and pulls you to a booth."Now we are going to play a little game.  McGowan has placed orders with a number of smaller operators for drugs.  In a few hours, we'll have a shipment for you to deliver.  Only thing is, your containers aren't going to be filled with Hammerhead, or Fly, or Goofjuice.  They are going to be packed with explosives.  Since the orders are being filled by so many groups, it has been easy for our spies to discover what the passwords and delivery schedules are.  Do you want to make some evil men go boom?"                                       -A couple of days later, you are quietly enjoying the company of some of the Rovers in the bar, and discussing the types of operations you have been doing.  It seems that McGowan may be starting to suspect the Geese, and you have noted that the number of unexpected ships passing through Tuatha has increased.  Apparently, too, the Geese in Spacedock Six have been getting harassed by more interdictions than normal.Flannigan walks in and orders a drink, and you head over to see if he has any information for you."Hello <PN>, How have you been?"  Flannigan asks you, lifting his glass in greeting.You and Flannigan are exchanging pleasantries when Tara Collins rushes into the Bar.  She hands Flannigan a data-cube, and he quickly loads it into his wrist-comp and scans its contents.  Flannigan jumps to his feet, and indicates that you should follow him into the corridor."<PN>, I have been waiting for this to happen," he states, suddenly business-like.  "With all the problems we have been creating for McGowan, many of his regular sources of information are beginning to doubt McGowan's strength.  Some of our operatives have been able to discover the position of McGowan's main prison ship.  The sadist likes to capture those who may well prove to be opposed to his pirate organization.  There is one individual who is currently languishing in McGowan's prison ship, the 'Desperation' that we are particularly interested in talking to.  His name is Eiric, and he is attempting to create a union of free traders to combat the position of McGowan's organization.  Or at least he was, until he was captured by McGowan, and put into the 'Desperation'.  We now know where the dread ship is, and want you to go and raid her, freeing the prisoners and in particular Eiric.  Are you interested?"                                       	tWhen you land you are met by Flannigan, Tara Collins and the brothers Sean and Ryan O'Driscol.  After wordlessly gripping each other's arms in greeting, Tara, Sean and Ryan start helping the former prisoners off your ship.  You cannot help but wonder what happened to Flynn, and you raise your eyebrows in anxious curiosity.  Flannigan shakes his head."He personally kept the Bureau's thugs bottled up in one corner of the space port for the better part of ten minutes," Flannigan says proudly, with tears in his eyes, "so that we could get everybody away.  He died well and hard."You close your eyes in remembrance of a man with the quick wit and even quicker smile who greeted you as a {G "brother" "sister"}.  After a moment of gut-wrenching reverie, you open your eyes, ready to do whatever has to be done to avenge all that has been done to the Wild Geese and the people they protect.Flannigan draws you away from the crowds in the spaceport"We are in something of a fix," he begins quietly, and you chuckle at his understatement.  "The Bureau hit us hard while we were concentrating on McGowan and his damn 'guild of free traders'.  We barely escaped alive, all of us, and the fault is partly mine.  I knew that McGowan had an agreement with the Bureau, but I didn't know they were quite this cozy.  I don't have a lot of time to explain all the ins and outs of the situation, but the end result is that I'm going to declare war on both McGowan's so-called 'guild' and on that damned Bureau.  Unfortunately for us we have absolutely no way of winning on our own."That's why I'm glad you found us as quickly as you did," he explains, nodding in appreciation, "I need someone to open talks with those who we will need as allies.  We basically have the Rebels that occupy some of the space to the galactic north of the Federation and the Aurorans to the south."He looks directly at you."You," he says, tapping you on the chest for emphasis, "have more experience with dealing with people outside the Wild Geese than anyone here bar myself.  And seeing as I have a few other things I need to be taking care of, you'll be our representative."I have a contact inside the Rebellion," he informs you all quietly, "and, as you probably already know I have many contacts among the Aurorans.  I'll leave it up to you."Do you want to go meet the Rebels, or the Aurorans?"                                       
÷As soon as you step into this establishment your eye is distracted by a waving hand in the back corner.  Looking over you see the {g "lovely Tara Collins" "handsome Ryan O'Driscol"} trying to get your attention.  With a smile you head over to say hello.  After a quick hug, {G "Tara" "Ryan"} indicates that you should sit down.{G "\"The Bureau tracked us down a couple of days ago,\" Tara begins explaining in a slightly shy manner.  \"We had to evacuate from here, but Eamon left me here to wait for you.  He said that he had sent word to an Auroran warrior named Techerakh that you would be coming, and that you would be carrying word of our plight to him.  You have to meet with him on the Heraan planet in the Heraan system, which is somewhere to the galactic west of the capital of the Auroran Empire.\""  "\"  The Bureau managed to catch up with us a few days ago,\" Ryan explains in his thick brogue, \"and Eamon had to stay with the evacuees.  I was left behind to pass on the message that you are to go and see an Auroran warrior named Techerakh on the Heraan planet in the Heraan system which is located somewhere to the galactic west of the Auroran capital.  Apparently he will be expecting you, and you are to pass on our current situation.\""}You nod slowly as you digest this.{G "\"Would you mind terribly,\" Tara asks shyly, \"staying and having a few drinks?  It would be nice to hear of news from the rest of the galaxy.\""  "\"  Before you go though,\" says Ryan with an unusual hint of humility, \"would you mind having a few quiet drinks with me?  We could talk of old times, and remember old friends...\""}You find yourself smiling without really knowing why, and agreeing to {G "her" "his"} request.  And before you know it, you are having a great time as the two of you talk about everything under the sun.  {G "You never knew Tara was so knowledgeable about the world, and before the night is over you find yourself promising to her to do this again sometime, and you surprise yourself by actually meaning it.  The with a quick, soft kiss, and a shy smile, she is gone, leaving you wishing for more..." "As time goes by, you find yourself warming to Ryan as he regales you with the tales of his life.  You catch a glimpse behind the facade of a likeable rogue into a deep, serious and incredibly passionate man, and you find yourself liking what you see.  Before the night is over he has managed to persuade you to do this again sometime, and you are slightly surprised to discover that you really would like to see him again.  Finally he gives you a hug and rakishly kisses your hand before heading off, trying to casually whistle a tune whilst trying not to fall over from all the alcohol he consumed."}                                       tWhen you regain consciousness, the area around you is covered with blood.  Some of it is pooled in places, but all of it indicates that the bodies of the fallen have been removed.  You lift your head, and you see Michaleen.  He is sitting slumped against the wall, covered in blood but smiling still."I've never seen that tactic before," he grins merrily.  "Deliberately knocking yourself out to trip up the enemy.  Maybe I can do that next time and you can take care of them after that."You smile, and immediately wish you had not, as the skin across your face feels like it has been mashed with a mallet."Yeah," Michaleen laughs at your obvious discomfort, "I've never seen someone head butt another man's foot so hard!  Very good thinking though, you did break his foot!  Nothing like using your head in a fight as Flannigan always says."

You are about to ask what is going on when Eamon Flannigan stalks into the bar, followed by three others including a brow-beaten Michaleen."Ah, <PN>, I see you have already met the others.  These with me make up the rest of the Wild Rovers.  The Rovers are the closest thing the Wild Geese have to Special Forces.  The eight people you see here are the most resourceful individuals on all New Ireland.  They are used primarily as spies, but are also capable of demolitions work, assassination, anything really.  Now, I've called them all here to outline the plan against Pennant and the Sol Sector branch of McGowan's organization."Eamon goes over the background of the situation, of how Michaleen was tasked to infiltrate the organization and assess its strengths and weaknesses; how he got into trouble when he owed the criminals a lot of money, and how they responded by trying to kill him.  The Rovers are quiet throughout the meeting, silently drinking their drinks and listening to Flannigan.  You get the impression that at any other time they would be a lot of fun, but that the current situation calls for a certain level of professionalism.Flannigan concludes his briefing with an outline of the plan to come.  The Rovers would separate and enter the Sol system.  Each two man team would be responsible for the destruction of a different sphere of McGowan's organization.  When each team had finished their tasks they will return to New Ireland.  "O' course, we could always use another man," he says as he claps a hearty hand over your shoulder.                                       PYou are sitting waiting for Flannigan, and Flynn has been telling you all about his recent adventures.  You do a lot of flying, but Flynn has been from one end of the universe to the other so many times that he would have easily eclipsed your journeys.  All of his missions involve some sort of espionage, from destroying installations, to planting bugs and wires in crucial places.  You are beginning to get a grasp of how large the Wild Geese's intelligence network is, and you ask Flynn how the Geese maintain such a high level of security and awareness in what is a constantly changing world."That's simple," he says, sipping his pint.  "We Geese come from a long line of usurpers.  Our ancestors fought in so many wars after being forced into exile for their political ideologies, that we have almost evolved into the unit we are now.  Where some people tell their wains about 'The Three Little Bugbears' or 'The Princess Bride', we get told stories about 'Michael Collins and the Flying Columns' or the battles of 'Rory of the Glen'.  Guerilla tactics are like mother's milk to us.  Intelligence and counter-intelligence are easy if you have been trained in them since you have been able to listen."You are still musing over this information when Flannigan arrives.  He quickly walks up to you and pulls you to a booth."Now we are going to play a little game.  McGowan has placed orders with a number of smaller operators for drugs.  In a few hours, we'll have a shipment for you to deliver.  Only thing is, your containers aren't going to be filled with Hammerhead, or Fly, or Goofjuice.  They are going to be packed with explosives.  Since the orders are being filled by so many groups, it has been easy for our spies to discover what the passwords and delivery schedules are.  Do you want to make some evil men go boom?"                                       äYou are sitting down, enjoying a drink when you see Flannigan and Michaleen walk in, both looking grim."We need you to go into the dragon's lair," says Flannigan without preamble once they make their way over.  "From what intelligence I've been able to gather, this guild that McGowan is in charge of is a little more capable than I thought they were.  They have ties with the Bureau, and some of their equipment could only have come from them."I'm going to be sending you to make a peace proposal," Flannigan says showing you a data-cube and holding up his other hand to forestall your protests.  "We do not have the manpower to defeat them, and if we do get dragged into a war with them, we will probably get blind-sided by the Federation through their ties with the Bureau."We have hurt them," Flannigan notes quietly, "and hopefully, we can negotiate a truce without further incident, if I can get McGowan to see that the cost to his damned guild of so-called 'associated traders' would also be detrimental to their purpose of amassing wealth."Are you prepared to risk your life to be our envoy?" he asks quietly.                                       ÒAs you sit, drink in hand wondering what it is about McGowan that bothers you, an expectant hush falls over the bar and you look around to see McGowan, and a number of his bully-boys have walked into the bar.  Noting you sitting near the rear, they make their way over.As soon as McGowan sits down his bully-boys set upon you.  You desperately try to defend yourself, but there are simply too many of them for you to do anything effective.  Possibly only two or three minutes later the beating abates and one of the thugs lifts you off the floor to face McGowan."I have accepted Mr. Flannigan's proposal," he says, unperturbed by your condition.  "I will no longer launch operations against the Wild Geese if they do not launch against us.  As for you, I am warning you never to return to this place whilst I am alive.  I don't know what it is, but there is something offensive about you, and I will not tolerate your presence any more than I have to."With that, he gets up and starts walking out of the bar.  The man holding you up drops you to the ground and you remain there, unmoving for some time before levering yourself up.Not a single person in the bar makes eye contact with you as you leave this establishment.                                       As you sit, drink in hand, wondering what it is about McGowan that bothers you, an expectant hush falls over the bar and you look around to see McGowan, and a number of his bully-boys, have walked into the bar.

[As you sit waiting, drink in hand, tears come to your eyes more than once as you think of the times you and Michaleen had together.  The other patrons see your obvious distress and give you a respectful space in which to grieve.Eventually Flannigan walks in and makes his way over."I too will miss the boy," he says in his deep voice.  "He was foolhardy and inclined to let his mouth talk without engaging his brain, but there were none finer to have at your back in battle."He looks directly at you for a moment and you share a moment of silence for your friend.  Finally Flannigan shakes himself, and adopts a more business-like manner."You," he says, tapping you on the shoulder for emphasis, "have more experience with dealing with people outside the Wild Geese than anyone here bar myself.  And because I have a few other things I need to be taking care of, once again you'll be our representative."I have a contact inside the Rebellion," he informs you quietly, "and I need you to go and talk to him to find out more about McGowan's movements.

He slides into a chair."So," he says, "You must be <PN>.  Rumor has it that you're battle-handy, not up to my caliber, but you might be the pilot I'm looking for.""And why would you be looking for me?" you reply with a wry smile."My House needs a blockade runner," he explains directly, and you immediately assume that he is an Auroran warrior, which arouses your caution.  "It is too soon to bring the military might of the House to bear, so I'm asking if you will run cargo to the port of Dominance in the Heraan Cov system.  Interested...?"                                       çWhen you enter the bar on Codec, you are surprised to see the same giant who offered you the last cargo run is talking to a couple of spacers in the corner.  When he sees you walk in, he heads over."So, <PN>, I see that this time you have sought me.  On completing your last mission you must have been told where I am.  Are you ready to return to Dominance?"                                       ÇBariod, as the dockmaster introduces himself, asks if you can keep a secret."Why am I worthy of such trust?" you ask."Only a pilot of skill and honor would transport weapons enough to outfit a small system and not think about stealing them."  (You don't have the heart to tell him that you had no idea what you were carrying.)  "So, will you please deliver these sealed orders to Bazara, my brother?  He's the man from whom you have been receiving your shipments.  He's currently on Skye in the Murasaki system.  However, he will not be there for long, so you must hurry.  Will you carry them for me?"                                       zWhen you step into the bar you quickly spot the huge form of Bazara sitting in a table near the entrance.  He waves you over."I have only one more shipment to make," he begins in his direct matter, "then I return to be the warrior that I am.  If you will return with me and my team to Dominance, your reward will be handsome.  Interested?"                                       ·You have barely walked into the bar when all conversation around you ceases.  A man walks towards you, the weight of ages upon his withered shoulders.He looks you up and down, and smiles broadly.  "So, you must be <PN>, the pilot who so greatly impressed my two Kachi.  You must be good, very good, for they are not easy to impress.  I understand that you wish to serve House Heraan.  Are you willing to face the trials required to enter it?"                                       Midday.  Awakening from too much ale, with heavy head but light heart, you bid your new-found friends adieu, and go for a brief jaunt to freshen up before your journey.Along the promenades and balconies of the enormous Heraan family arcology, you feel a strange sense of destiny.  Here are people {b800"at least as""far more"} decent and honorable than those you have left behind.  Yet...With only a little trepidation you continue on your way to your ship to begin your journey to Gungungun.                                       `Upon touching down on Heraan, you are welcomed with open arms by Kuron, who confirms your place amongst the warriors of the House."Albeit the least, as yet!" he smiles.  "There is work to be done, even for the youngest.  Come, this will require your skill, ingenuity, more than a little patience, and discipline."                                       cYou are enjoying the feeling of Esprit de Corps that comes from being with the warriors in the bar.  Kuron comes in and pulls you aside."I am afraid I am going to have to send you on a mission right away, rather than allowing you time to recover from your training and kill off a few more brain cells.  Tactically, you are the best candidate for this mission.  It involves much travel and a face unknown to our enemies.  I am going to use you while you are fresh, to confound our enemies in their plans to hinder us."Outside the bar, Kuron pulls you towards the dock.  "Bazara has disappeared.  His last report said that the Federation was onto him, and that his effectiveness as a spy may well be gone.  He told us that if he didn't send a report by today, we were to consider him compromised and send someone to rescue him."                                       You feel rather foolish standing at the bar in nothing but a {G"loincloth" "loincloth, worried that your uncovered chest will draw the wrong type of attention"}.  The attention you attract, however, is polite respect and not the {G"ridicule" "licentiousness"} you expected.  In the distance you see Kuron approaching.  Fully clothed?  Only when he gets closer do you realize most of his skin is covered in tattoos.  Only now do you realize the significance of near-nakedness to an Auroran.  The tattoos display a warrior's career.  The more tattoos, the more honored the warrior.You look down at your pitifully small collection, and understand why Kuron continually tattooed your kills on your arm.  As you look at them, each one springs freshly to mind.                                       ÀYou are sitting in the bar observing the Moashi dogs, disguised as a humble worker, dirty from the days toils, listening in the hope that one of them will let slip something about the traitor."I strongly suggest you get out of our seat, {G"'friend'" "'miss'"}," hisses the leader of a small group of what you guess passes for warriors amongst the Moash, and, in keeping with your disguise, you slide off their seat, keeping your eyes down."Just like that scum that Am'Rosso sent those guys to meet," sneers the leader, and the others laugh and your ears pick up as Am'Rosso is the name of the Moash Thurokiir.  "Apparently the Heraani weakling didn't want to be seen anywhere in Auroran space so he sent a message saying to meet him somewhere in Federation space.  But then I suppose that it is fitting that it will be cowardice that will finally be the downfall of their supposed 'House'."As you digest this information, you let your rage slowly dissipate away.  You remind yourself that the yapping of dogs is meaningless, and no true warrior would react to it.You slowly finish your drink and start making your way back to the spaceport to start searching through the Federation.                                       7As you sit sipping your drink a crusty old spacer sits next to you with his drink."You're one of those Auroran warriors, aren't you?' he asks rhetorically, not even waiting for an answer.  "Don't see too many of your kind outside of your ships up here in the Federation.  You would want to watch yourself, or the Bureau will drag you in to have a word to you."Mind you," he continues rambling on, "the last one of you guys I mentioned that to didn't pay too much attention, but then the last time I saw him, he was headed towards New England, and everybody knows that only the old retirees from the military or the Bureau live there, so maybe he knew someone who still had a little clout."You listen quietly as a he rambles on, and you even buy him another drink.  He tells you his life story, which bores you no end, but that first snippet of information was worth every long minute you spend in his company.Finally you manage to disengage yourself politely and head off toward your ship, finally with a specific destination in mind.                                       &You are summoned before the Council by a messenger.  He stops you fetching your loincloth with a laugh."That is only worn on formal occasions.  The clothes you have on will suffice for now."In an annex of the great hall, Kuron indicates for you to sit at the table with Bazara, Nuada Skullsplitter, the head of the Family, and his adviser Tuatha Widowmaker.  The Thurokiir, Techerakh the Bloody Hammer, imposes over the gathering.  His tattoos are so closely packed that it is all but impossible to see his actual flesh color.Kuron talks of the corruption and complacency of the Moash, leading the Auroran people down a dark path of little hope.  He speaks of the ascendancy of the House of Heraan, and the work to topple the House Moash."It is our belief," he intones seriously, "that we only need to find their weaknesses in order to crush them utterly.""Little Wolf," he says.  "You will not be a typical Auroran warrior.  You will be an integral part of House Heraan's war machine: a spy, a phantom of retribution, a thorn in the flesh of the Federation, a turner of tides.  Yours will be a lonely path, and a dangerous one.  I saw the potential in you, as did Karlaekaar.  Your skill is great.  If you fulfil your potential, you'll be a major worry for our enemies."                                       ∫Techerakh spies you sitting chatting to a few other warriors as soon as he walks in to the bar.  He ushers you to a quiet corner."Swift action is required.  Things are afoot here that even our combined minds could not have foreseen.  The Dani have begun to sniff about the borders of Heraani space like the dogs that they are.  It is necessary that they do not cause too much havoc.  Our warriors are still smarting from the Moashi blockade.  'Twould also be politic at the moment if the other Houses knew little about the strengths or weaknesses of House Heraan.  The Dani must withdraw without forcing our lads into a swirling battle across a multitude of systems.  No doubt the Moashi have put them up to it from behind the scenes.  Cunning curs, the Moashi, avoiding suspicion by bullying us by proxy.""So!  You will lead a raiding force into Dani space.  I suggest hitting the Dani Himear system, as my intelligence tells me that they have an elite formation of warships patrolling there while their normal fleets are out harassing us.  If you spot them, destroy them.  But be warned.  By the time you start to jump back to Heraani space, the Dani war fleets posturing on our borders will have turned around, heading for home.  You'll have to come back through that way."  Techerakh grins at you.  You get the impression that if you were forced to give the Dani a bloody nose on your way home, Techerakh wouldn't mind...                                       :Techerakh waves to you as soon as you enter.  You get the feeling that he is well in his cups, but his mood is extremely jovial.  As you sit down, Karrod proffers you a large stein.  You take a long pull, and gasp, eyes watering, as the strength of the booze hits you.  Techerakh and Karrod laugh so hard that they almost fall from their chairs.Once they have calmed down (and you work out that you can see straight if you squint your right eye) Techerakh explains why you are feeling the effects more than normal."A great warrior I know introduced me to this drink.  It's called an Irish Boilermaker.  A fine fellow that Archindar..." Techerakh drifts into his memories for a moment, then continues.  "...anyway, we are celebrating your latest honor.""And what honor ish that?" you slur at Techerakh, much to Karrod's amusement."You are being sponsored to serve with the Rimertans, my young {G"hero" "heroine"},"  Techerakh chuckles.  "Only the greatest of warriors are allowed to do this, as it requires the sponsorship of the Thurokiir of a House.  The Rimertans can always turn down the deal of course, but they have always accepted warriors from House Heraan."  You are about to ask more about your upcoming assignment when Kuron and Bazara enter the bar.  The night seems to blur away...                                       When you enter you see Hune and Lo Wang sitting at a table near the door."The Dechtakars have heard of raids by houseless warriors on the frontier settlement of <DST> in the <DSY> system," Lo Wang informs you quietly after you sit down.  "The Auroran settlers have discovered a valuable deposit of palladium, but these honorless thieves have been plundering their shipments as they leave the planet.  You and Hune are charged with sorting out the culprits."Hune looks at you strangely, "Do you accept?"                                       BUpon landing you are met by Lo Wang, who informs you that a Moashi dignitary named Duradar will soon be visiting his great nephew on <RST> in the <RSY> system.  His rank is sufficiently high to require an escort to the strife-ridden border settlement.  This time you will be sent without Hune to escort him from here to <RST>.You struggle with your rage at being used in such a lowly manner, but after a moment you calm yourself and begin to realize that you are being tested, and that Lo Wang is waiting for your answer.  What will it be?                                       ‘As you sit in the bar, sipping the drink bought for you by Hune, Lo Wang walks in and comes over to you."The Wild Geese have made a strike against Auroran interests in the <RSY> system," he informs you.  "We need you two to reinforce those Auroran interests in the system."Once again there is that odd moment of silence as both Hune and Lo Wang await your answer to the implied question of whether or not you will do your duty.                                       ˜On returning to Heraan you are met with much rejoicing by your friends.  It has been a long time between drinks!  Techerakh tells you that he has need to speak to you tomorrow about the future direction of House Heraan, and that you are to play an important role in it, both behind the scenes and in the spotlight.It is with a monstrous hangover that you make your way to Techerakh's quarters the next morning.  You arrive to see him stripped to the waist, engaging a number of holographic opponents.  Sweat shines on his bare body, making the images of death and destruction that adorn him writhe and take life.  You politely wait for him to finish, and when he does so he sits down beside you and begins your briefing.                                       RThe mood in the bar is one of quiet waiting.  The Council has been planning a new battle group, and most predict that you will be leading them.  Many warriors have challenged you of late, from wrestles to simulated combat in ships varying from fighter size to capital ships.  You are exhausted most of the time, but you know why they are doing it; they wish to impress you with their prowess, trying to become part of the legend that is rising around you.  Those who challenge you are paying you a great honor.Most of the available warriors in the House have been recalled to Heraan, and the bars are all full of restless, loincloth-clad bodies, and the air is heady with the scent of tattoo ink.  With anticipation you head for the Great Hall.  A crowd gathers behind you, many of those present having duelled with you in the past few weeks.  By the time you meet Bazara, the crowd has swelled further."Well," he glances behind you.  "I see you must have on a new {G"aftershave" "perfume"}!"Karrod steps from inside Bazara's quarters and continues, "Hmmm," he sniffs you loudly.  "Smells like success to me."You glower at the two of them as they laugh long and hard, but realize that there isn't much point.  Bazara and Karrod are like most warriors.  They take little seriously, unless it is war or death.  The three of you head for the hall.  Karrod tells you that after the Council meeting he wants you to meet his son, Jesura, just back from the Federation front.  Karrod has spoken highly of him in the past, as have Techerakh and Bazara, and you are keen to meet him.  You bring your focus back to the present as you enter the familiar dimness of the Hall.The sounds of conversation dies away as Kuron steps into the firelight.  He strikes the flagstones with his staff and begins."Fellow warriors, you have been called here to endorse a new battle group.  Like the Auroran warriors of old, it will travel the universe battling with prowess and skill.  There will be a reckoning in the land as House Heraan walks the warrior's 'Path of Strength'.  It is the contention of the council that the Moash House has been First Family too long, and that House Heraan must take over that position if we Aurorans are to prosper."The roar for the assembly deafens, and you roar with the others.  As the cheering dies down, Kuron continues."This new battle group will be working directly with me and with Techerakh the Bloody Hammer.  The Mundokiir and Thurokiir will guide them and use them to bring about the destruction of the Moash House."Again more cheering, which forces Kuron to wait.  It is during these few moments that Kuron makes eye contact with you, and you know for sure that you are to lead this new group.  Your heart hammers in your chest."The new group will be known as 'The Pack' and their leader will be the mighty KarHallarn.                                       üTecherakh and Kuron allow you very little time to rest before sending you and your team on another mission.Kuron grins.  "The Pirates are being torn by internal strife, and the old balance of power among them has begun to shift.  We must know what is going on up in the galactic north.  My spies report there is a new player on the patch.  I'm sending you to meet with him, and Bazara to meet with his immediate enemy, the notorious McGowan."It is important that you get a feel for this fellow called Eiric," he continues earnestly. {b809 "You rock back in your chair at the mention of the name. This Eiric is almost certainly the man you rescued before. " " "}"McGowan we can deal with because we know that he has very little honor and wants only for riches and power.  His kind are easy to anticipate.  This Eiric may be a different man altogether{b809 ", although by your reaction,\" he smiles, \"I think this may be a man we count on." "."}  Techerakh would be going himself but he has headed off on important business, so Nuada has requested that you go in his stead."I don't have to tell you how important this mission is," Kuron finishes off-handedly, "so don't muff it or I'll kick your backside till it's blue.  Your pack won't be going with you, as they will be going on missions of their own.  The game is afoot my friend, and soon it will be time to play for the entire box and dice."                                       ÉOn entering the bridge of your ship, you notice the flashing message light.  You quickly enter your voiceprint, and scan.  Kuron informs you that the Moashi have begun a push against the outer systems of Heraani Space.  There are distress messages flooding in from various points, and that you are required to head for Heraan with all possible speed.                                       NKuron meets you all just inside the entrance of the hall.  He looks both weary and strangely joyous.  He meets your looks of pain and despair with a wry smile."Why all the long faces?  Did he die a coward?"  The shock of what Kuron says stops you in your tracks."I guess you don't yet know how, so I'll tell you and let you all decide for yourselves.  The Moashi Fleet you all rushed to stop was only sent for him.  And the fool knew it.  So what does he do?  He speeds to meet them.  He gave an excellent account of himself, making a mockery of the Moashi's best.  By the time he fell, the Moashi had lost 20 fighters, a cruiser and a carrier.  All this he did, even while facing their Mundokiir.  Yes my brothers, the Moashi sent the "Eye of Fury" to claim him.  So tell me this, who has found peace in the Hall of Heroes, and who still have the lion's work cut out for them."Kuron smiles sadly."Yes, I'll miss that man a great deal, and unfortunately all of our plans must wait until we find a new Thurokiir.  That is why I waited for you all to return."                                       
}Despite the night before, you are unable to rest, and a bleakness has settled on your spirit.  For so long, Techerakh had been a rock to which you were able to anchor yourself.  So did the whole House, you realize with a frown.  Leaving {G"Savard" "Jesura"} asleep, you stalk silently from the room, heading towards Techerakh's quarters to go through his personal effects.Kuron had told you of the tradition, but you dread the task.  You feel as if it will place Techerakh forever beyond your reach, but you feel that is why the new Thurokiir must do so, so that they may fully carry the mantle of responsibility.You enter the dim confines of Techerakh's unit, and are surprised to see a holo-projector with a note to you attached to it.  You pick it up and initiate its sequencer...and suddenly Techerakh comes to life before your eyes."Hello {G"me boyo" "lass"}," he smiles at you, and you feel the tears leap unbidden to your eyes."Well, I guess I have died, and my hunch about the Moashi was right.  Damn, I so wanted to be there when we marched on to victory.  Ah well, I'll save you a spot at my table in the hall of heroes.  Now, down to business.  I have become very concerned about the number of our vessels being pulled away for duty on the border.  Theoretically, all the Houses defend it equally, but lately the requests for Heraani ships have increased significantly.  It is starting to leave us undermanned in the inner systems.  Now if I have died, all the warriors will have gathered here.  Our enemies will either attack our borders now, or will wait for all of our lads and lassies to return to their far flung posts, and then make a strike for Heraan itself.  Now that you are Arbiter, you have to carry the weight of the whole House on your shoulders.  Don't fret.  I made sure that your shoulders were {G"wide" "strong"} enough!  You must determine which of the two theories is true, and than act upon it.  So much is at stake now.  The Moashi are as slippery as eels, as cunning as cutter-House rats.  They know we are making a push, and have plans in place to foil us.  If they win, then the Heraani will cease to exist.  They will blast us into atoms, leaving only dogs to lick at their heels.  Don't let that happen!  Now I know you don't feel like you can succeed, {G"boy" "girl"}, but don't worry, neither did I when I was in your place.  Just remember, I have faith in you!  I know that you will lead us to victory.  When we are First House, unite the Aurorans.  You have the wits to do it, for I have seen it in you.  Unite us, then lead us to victory..."Techerakh's image fades, and you are alone once more.                                        ˜You and Hune set out with a minimum of delay, and soon begin your tour of the border, paying particular attention to the many Auroran 'Listening' Posts that make up the first line of the defense for the Empire.                                       LNo sooner have you touched down than there is a commotion on the flightdeck.  You barely have time to disembark before a Dechtakars messenger steps forward and delivers you a data chip.  You quickly load it into your wristcomp, and read the contents of the communique.You gasp as you read, "House Moash has accused the Heraani of neglecting their duty to the Auroran Empire by not providing enough troops and vessels to man the Federation border."You allow the rage to build inside you as you read further."They also accuse House Heraan of being in league with the Federation and of using their influence with the mortal enemies of the Auroran Empire to destroy the other four Houses in preparation for seizing the Empire."The audacity of the Moashi amazes you.  They have accused House Heraan of all the actions they themselves have undertaken.  The communique demands that you travel to Aurora and speak on behalf on House Heraan.  You stalk back into your ship, and quickly send a message to Hune, asking him to meet you on Aurora, as soon as possible.                                       ≤No sooner have you left the Great Council Hall, then a young Heraani warrior rushes up to you."KarHallarn," he pants, and you get the impression that he has been running a long time, "The Moash Fleets left Aurora hours ago, and appear to be headed into Heraani space."Your blood chills.  Realizing that they have failed in their bid to destroy House Heraan politically, the Moashi have decided to try old fashioned force of arms.  You rush towards your ship, the House must be warned.Your first communication is with Kuron, who is still overjoyed by your victory at the Auroran Council.  But he quickly realizes the plight House Heraan is in.  With the bulk of its fighting capability on the Federation border, there is little standing in the way of House Moash smashing Heraan and killing the Heart of the House.  Kuron begs you to buy him some time to mount a defense.  You tell him that you will try.                                       aYou are sitting in the bar, trying to banish the ghosts of the past, when your wristcomp beeps an incoming message.  You look down and read that you have been challenged to a duel by Am'Rosso, Thurokiir of House Moash, to be held in the Great Hall of Aurora.Wearily you get to your feet and make your way to your ship.  Kuron, from his hospital bed, informed the House Elders to expect this challenge, as the Moash will be trying to win back some honor.  Kuron had asked you what you intended to do when the challenge came, but you told him you had no idea.  Now you do.                                       /Initially the other houses stick the boot in to the remaining Moashi fleet.  You only stop the other houses when it gets out of hand.Before too long you are seated at the First House's position of the Great Auroran Council beside Kuron the Silver Arm (so named now in honor of his new cybernetic limb).  The other four Houses quietly await the Thurokiirs Address."Brothers and Sisters of the Auroran Empire," you begin, "the days of fighting among ourselves must end.  In disunity we will stay under the boot of the Federation.  They take our lives, take our resources, treat us with disdain, and fail to see that we are their equals, if not their betters."We have been at war with them for generations, but the days of stalemate are over.  Soon we will begin a campaign against the Federation, the likes of which has not been seen since the days of early contact."Look about you.  Are our differences so great that the Auroran Nation cannot push forward?  We go to win our right as the pre-eminent warriors in the universe.  All I ask is that you are patient, and keep the fighting amongst ourselves limited.  I have a much grander vision in mind.  House Heraan believes in that vision.  Do you?"The Hall erupts to the cheers of the massed warriors.  You take it that they agree.                                       °You meet with Frandall in a dimly lit bar on Goliath.  He shakes your hand and offers you a seat.  You wonder how many of the people in the bar are rebel operatives.  You have a feeling that Frandall is pretty thorough, leaving nothing to chance.  But then, like most non-Aurorans, he would be afraid of dying."Hello KarHallarn," he says.For a master spy, Frandall does not exactly look the part, but then you guess that is the whole point."Mu'Randa has told me what you intend, and I have in turn spoken with the Rebel High Command.  We have already reached an impasse.  The Rebellion will not support the Auroran Empire if it conquers the Federation.  I'm afraid that we feel your bad system of government is little better than the Federation's worse one.""And what would it take for the Rebellion to come aboard?"  you ask."Well, for starters, a judicial system would be good..."                                       ÊYou discuss the possible entry points into Federation Space from the Auroran Border."It is most likely going to be through Roughneck Territory."  Kuron waves a silver limb towards the ceiling.  "The only problem is the poxing Roughnecks themselves.  Every time I have considered attacking the Federation, I stumble on the Roughnecks.  I have to admit that they would probably hold any advance long enough for the Federation to reinforce the area and push us back."So do the Roughnecks have anybody who would take them apart?  I know that our warriors would be able to take them, but we don't have time.  We have to skip through the system and push on into Federation space."You think about the possibility, when Kuron suddenly slaps the table.  "I know who to get," he beams at you "listen, by the time you get back from meeting the Polaris and the Rebels, I'll have someone else to meet you."You finish your drink, and think over the upcoming meetings.                                       ùYour next stop is in Goliath.  Frandall will be waiting for you, so you set off without delay.  You secretly hope that the Rebels will take your offer.  While you know that you would ultimately win any war with them, it makes you uncomfortable to think about a guerilla war.  Aurorans do not think highly of that sort of fighting, which would give the rebels a huge advantage.                                       cKuron meets you in the bar and sits down.  He is excited about something, but with all the to-ing and fro-ing lately, you are starting to wonder whether or not it is worth the hassle."It WOULD probably be easier to just kill everybody," you begin.Kuron laughs.  "I have set up another meeting for you, but this one is pretty easy," Kuron begins, taking a long draught of Ale, "I know the man very well.  In fact he was a battle brother to Techerakh, in the early days.  A great warrior, Archindar, otherwise know as Eamon Flannigan.  He is the leader of the Wild Geese."                                       gAs you sit on the launch pad on New England awaiting your prey, suddenly you get a warning buzz from your sensor array, and immediately see a Federation fleet jumping into the system.  Krane must have been tipped off!  In the middle of the fleet is her ship.  You know that you will be lucky to survive the battle, but with so much at stake, you must kill that woman, or your whole plan will fall apart.With cold-resolve you launch your ship skyward, vowing to succeed and to find somewhere to land to send off the necessary long-distance signals to the waiting battle fleets. ç ≈With Krane dead, you contact the Rebels, the Wild Geese and the Polaris to inform them to begin their campaigns before sitting back to ponder the events to come.  You decide that it is probably a good time to head back to Heraan to see if there is anything else you need to do.  If all goes even vaguely well, the Federation will cease to exist before much longer, and you can settle down for a few weeks at least...                                       As you sit sipping your drink you see Techerakh with another Auroran warrior enter the bar and make his way over to you.  He introduces the man as Bariod, the dockmaster for the Dominance station."Archindar says that you are a pilot of skill and honor," he compliments you straightforwardly.  "So, will you please deliver these sealed orders to Bazara, my brother.  He's currently on Skye in the Murasaki system.  However, he will not be there for long, so you must hurry.  Will you carry them for me?"                                       .As you sit in the bar, sipping the drink bought for you by Hune, Lo Wang walks in and come over to you.  "The Wild Geese have made a strike against Auroran interests in the <RSY> system," he informs you.  "We need you two to reinforce the Auroran interests in the system."Once again there is that odd moment of silence as both Hune and Lo Wang await your answer to the implied question of whether or not you will do your {b800"duty, even against those who were your comrades whom you still hold in high regard" "duty"}.                                       7Just as you sit down you see a group made up of one man and two women, all with the soft, pallid look of scientists walk into the bar.  They remind you of the scientists from the terraforming team.  As soon as one of them spots you they all look in your direction and make their way over."Are you <PN>, Captain of the <PSN>?" asks one of the women, and when you nod in confirmation they all grin.  "Allow me to introduce myself, I'm Sarah Tanner, and we're from the Nirvana Terraforming and Stellar Engineering company, I believe you have worked with our company before?"When you slowly nod your head, they beam proudly."We have a proposal for you," Sarah continues brightly.  "Would you be interested in re-terraforming New Ireland?"You look at them incredulously for a moment.                                       |Kuron meets you in the bar and sits down.  He is excited about something, but with all the to-ing and fro-ing lately, you are starting to wonder whether or not it is worth the hassle."It WOULD probably be easier to just kill everybody," you begin.Kuron laughs.  "I have set up another meeting for you, but this one should be pretty for you," Kuron begins, taking a long draught of Ale.  "After all, you know the man very well.  In fact he was a battle brother to Techerakh, in the early days.  A great warrior, Archindar, otherwise know as Eamon Flannigan.  I believe you are familiar with him?"                                       ”As you sit sipping your drink you see Techerakh enter the bar and make his way over to you."It is time you started to earn your keep," he smiles quietly.  "So, will you please deliver these sealed orders to Bazara, my brother.  He's the man from whom you have been receiving your shipments.  He's currently on Skye in the Murasaki system.  However, he will not be there for long, so you must hurry.  Will you carry them for me?"                                        ÍBazara looks to you and says, "I have only one more shipment to make, then I return to be the warrior that I am.  If you will return with me and my team to Dominance, your reward will be handsome."                                       You duck into the small spaceport bar, and wait a moment for your eyes to adjust.  The 'Hallowed Owl' hasn't changed since your Academy holidays.  A little more rust, a little more stench; pretty much the same.A man with immense shoulders and flowing gray locks sits at a table off to the side of the bar- your uncle Olaf.  You can barely contain your joy at seeing him after ten years, and by the tears welling in his eyes you can see that he's similarly affected."Well, young'un!  You've grown out of all proportion," he says, eyeing you up and down with avuncular approval.  "Grub must be good at that Academy.  But small talk can wait.  There's little time, and much to do."  He looks you straight in the eye, and asks, "Do you think you're ready?"                                       É"Now that I've given ye a li'l test, and found out that ye can sail that pretty li'l ship o' yers around the universe, I need you to take some more supplies to Misfire in the <DSY> system and then return here.  I've been stockpiling some supplies and stuff o'er the years, and soon enough I think we'll have enough cash for ye to buy a better ship and start doing some real work t'wards yer destiny.  I know that the day o' reckoning seems far off, but while ye wez learnin' to sail and lead and navigate, I wez puttin' inta place all the mechanisms fer ye to retake what wez rightfully yers in the first place."You feel a lump rise in your throat.  You heard from Uncle Olaf often enough during your years at the academy, but he would never tell you exactly what he was doing.  Now you know, and feel a swell of pride and affection for the big man before you.                                       |You have barely stepped into the bar when Olaf pushes you back out."Sorry kid," he says, "But I've got a rush delivery to <DST> in the <DSY> system.  You need to get going right away.  Feel up to it?"You sigh.  Olaf has always been keen on keeping things working overtime.  You nod your assent, and turn and start heading back to the port.                                       Olaf turns to you as you enter the bar.  The last run has left you feeling a little drained; your clashes with pirates have left you short on fuel and patience.  "Rough trip?"  Olaf says as he raises a quizzical eyebrow in your direction."I am sick to death of having to deal with pirates," you say, waving for a drink.  "They are making life increasingly difficult for honest folk to make a living.  I'm going to have to kill a few people if this keeps up, but I have to admit that I don't mind saying that I'd kill off a hell of a lot more if I had the opportunity.  Why doesn't the Federation Navy just clean them out once and for all?"You see a dark look cross Olaf's face, and you catch yourself wondering what could have left Olaf so bitter.  For as long as you have known him he has held a grudge against the Central Government.  You have always felt it was because Olaf is a fair man, and one who is not afraid to speak out to expose injustice.  In his lifetime he has seen many horrible episodes, including the death of your parents.  He has never spoken of it to you, but you know that the scars still run deep in his heart from the events of that day.His gaze returns to your eyes, and you get the impression that the time is coming near for him to unburden himself of the horror he has carried for too long."Listen," he whispers as he takes your hand in his.  "Back in the old days, yer father was feeling much the same way.  Cut-throats intercepted his shipments, and the Federation made legal trade almost impossible, with their export taxes, and their exorbitant charges for escorts and other protection.  The Federation bled the small companies dry with their tithes, while cultivating the old Leviathans and their rich hereditary owners.  They maintained their monopoly with their kickbacks."Seeing as Unions and Associations had been outlawed, yer father decided to form a secret organization.  'The Association of Free Traders' was formed.  We shared information and risk by travelling in our own convoys with ships modified to carry armaments.  We built our own shipyard, out in the Galactic North where I was chief designer."It wasn't that we were criminals.  We just realized that the system wasn't fair for people like us, and that it was our duty to find ways to circumvent its holds.  As yer father used to say, 'When injustice becomes law, then resistance becomes duty.'""So what happened?" you ask.Olaf's expression darkens.  "McGowan.""Who?""McGowan," he glowers.  "Y'see, yer dad had became known as the "Pirate King" and life was good.  His ship 'Unrelenting' was one of the greatest ships I or anyone had ever built.  She was a heavily modified Carrier, with a better weapons platform and more powerful engines.  Slowly we began to lose more and more shipments to the Federation, and yer father sent McGowan to investigate why.  Yer father had seen his smarts and put him on the Board of Advisers, the controlling body of the Association.  McGowan organized a meeting between yer father, the Board of Advisers and the other privateers who hadn't joined the Association.  He said that they had information vital to the Association's survival."So the 'Unrelenting' and the others exited hyperspace at the meeting place, a far off system inhabited by no bugger, only to find the mother of all Federation battle-fleets waiting for them."It was a trap, and McGowan had betrayed us all.  Yer father marshalled a fierce last stand, allowing most of the fleets to jump to safety, but was killed in the process along with yer mum and almost every friend I had ever known.  I was one of the few to make it off 'Unrelenting' alive, and I brought ye with me."I vowed that they would be avenged, but I knew that I was not the man to do it.  My responsibility was to keep the promise I made to yer mother, to keep ye alive, so that ye may take yer place at the head of the organization of Free Traders.  And so that ye could make the Federation pay for their corruption, and avenge your parents, by killing the black hearted McGowan."                                       ˆOlaf waves to you as soon as you enter.  "Well, how was yer trip?  Are ye ready to set up the family business again?"You nod, and tell him that you are as ready as you are likely to be."Good, then lets get down to business.  Ye start by increasing the amount of money that ye're making.  Once ye're making more money, ye can start setting up safe havens, and secret warehouses and the like."Now in the old days, this was pretty hard, but now that the Rebels have been around for a while, we have a good place to start.  What happens now is that ye go to a meeting of the Rebel High Command.  They will hopefully allow ye to become one of their major shipment runners."The trick is simple.  Members of the Association are capable of running large shipments of goods without the Federation finding out about it.  The Rebels are always short on supplies.  Ye offer the services of the Association in return for a fee and the use of their network.  They will agree because ye will be a lot easier to deal with than having to organize their own shipments, and because it saves them the risks of Federation intervention.  If anybody gets caught, it means that they are not directly linked to it."So, am I a bright spark or what?"                                       You ask the barmaid to point out the off-duty dockmaster, and she points out a stocky fellow enjoying a quiet drink.He looks up as your shadow falls across his table.  "What can I do for you?" he asks politely.You explain your situation, saying that you were directed here to do something useful for the Rebellion that doesn't require you to have an enormous security clearance.  He looks at you and runs his hand through his graying hair."You must be the new privateer I've been hearing about," he muses thoughtfully for a moment before nodding.  "Okay, here's the deal.  The Bureau is trying to starve us out of the Federation, and people's belts are starting to look a little tighter."You willing to become a freight courier?"                                        üJay needs you to get <CQ> tons of <CT> to <DST> in the <DSY> system and bring it back to <RST>.

"Captain <PN>!" you hear yelled from the back of the bar in greeting as you enter.  "Over here!"You turn towards the voice and see Jay the dockmaster sitting enjoying a drink.  He kicks out a chair at his table and indicates that you should join him with a grin."I've been told to let you have access to a few more leg-work missions," he begins smiling, "but don't get carried away," he cautions, "it is only a small step up from food drops to equipment drops.  What it does mean is that some of the head sheds have noticed you.  If you keep this up, before long you will be up there with the big boys."Jay leans forward resting his heavily muscled arms on the table as he asks more seriously, "...that is, if you're still interested?"                                        üJay needs you to get <CQ> tons of <CT> to <DST> in the <DSY> system and bring it back to <RST>.

KYou see a waving hand as you step into the bar and you recognize Jay sitting in his normal place.You sit down and he grins at you."If you were going to start betraying the Rebellion," he says in jest, "now would be the time you could start."You look at him wondering exactly what he meant by that."The head-sheds have decided to move you up a little further," he continues quietly, "they want you to go and pick up a Rebel Informant who believes that she has been compromised.  Are you up to it, or do you need a little more time to prepare?"

But I've never heard of a privateer ever being allowed to get access to missions this highly classified, it's something of a tip of the hat to you that you are the first.

You discuss the options open to you with Olaf, and promote some more trusted members to help with the workload.  As soon as you create this board you realize why your father had done it all those years ago.  The Association begins to run smoother, and Olaf helps you to decide, with the help of the Advisers how best the money should be spent.  There are some troubles, but most can be dealt with.Olaf organizes some clandestine outfitting yards, and soon pirate versions of many ships begin to ply the space-lanes.  The Federation are dealt some bloody noses by the likes of the modified 'Enterprise', and the modified 'Starbridge' becomes the ship of preference for blockade runners.One day Olaf pulls you aside to deliver some news.                                       Olaf and Charlie embrace warmly, and you get the impression that there is a lot of history between them.  That night at the bar they reminisce about old times, and there is much laughter."So," Charlie waves at you, "when are you going to go and get the others?  God knows you'll need them.""Others?  What others," you ask, "and why will I need them?""All in good time, <PN>," Olaf slaps you on the back.  "Firstly, tomorrow I'll need ye to go and fetch Sven Fjordnham, the best radar operator in the known galaxy.  Ye'll find him at <RST> in the <RSY> system.  So go get him and come back.  I have further things to organize here"You feel a bit like an errand runner, but you have trusted Olaf your whole life, so you are not about to stop now.                                       ∫After settling Sven, you surprise Olaf.  He quickly shuts down the design terminal he was working at, and meets you as you cross the room.  The other Association staff laugh at his behavior, and you know that they know what Olaf is planning."Only two more.  Ye may as well pick 'em up at the same time.  On <RST> in the <RSY> system is Ferret, the best damn crew chief I have ever met.  Ferret knows how to deal with crew, from the Roughheads to the Bastards.  From idiots to lazy good-for-nothings.  Most crew are good, but Ferret, he can make the simplest of men perform better than ever."The second man I need you to fetch is Flynn "Dizzy" McHugh.  He usually hangs around Ferret.  If he's not around with Ferret, than at least Ferret should be able to point you in the right direction.  Now Dizzy could make a destroyer out-fly a fighter if he wanted.  Not that he hasn't in the past by the way.  He learned to fly the hard way, earning a keep for his family.  Even now the lad is barely old enough to shave.  One bright captain realized that Flynn was far too smart to grow up being some ship's boy, and discovered his knack for flying."If it's a civvy ship, then Dizzy has flown it.  He got the nickname while piloting leviathans at 14.  Apparently he made the crew dizzy with the things he was able to make that leviathan do.  So go get both of them and get back here.  I reckon I'll have something waiting for you."                                       
You burst into the shipyards to finds the production floor hung with bunting and streamers.  Balloons and laser light shows burst into life as soon as you enter, and everyone yells "SURPRISE".Out through the main view-port you can see the most vicious looking Carrier you have ever seen.  It has six huge engines that look more than capable for blasting it through Federation blockades.  The Weapons platform is immense, with more cannons than you have ever seen. Olaf approaches you and smiles at the stunned look on your face.  "I take it ye like yer new ship.  I have built a ship for ye the same way I built a ship for your Father.  This is yer birthright.  I have made her an updated version of the old 'Unrelenting'.  I'm glad that ye like her.  With a ship like this, ye can go about making the Association safe and strong like it used to be."You feel tears spring to your eyes, and Olaf puts his arm around you."Ahh, enough of that Bonnie, or yer new crew will think ye are a softie and try to walk all over ye.  Now come and meet them."Most of the bridge crew you have already met, and Olaf surprises you by telling you that he will handle the engineering section himself.  At least now you know why Olaf has been so secretive lately. ÂThe trap being set, the fleet sets out to flush out the enemy.  The mood on board is one of tense expectation.  The plan calls for you to disable enemy ships, so that they can be boarded and prisoners taken.  It goes without saying that the fighting will be brutal and fierce.  The possibility of death hangs on everyone, but the current situation must stop.  The enemy crews themselves will not be the chief source of information, but the enemy databanks will.  So you will have to disable and board whichever ship of theirs seems to be their command vessel.Getting ahold of the databanks will enable you to trace the movements of specific ships, tracking them to secret bases and rendezvous points.  It will also make it possible for you to read encoded messages, and decipher the identity of their senders.  Once you know that, you will be able to cross-reference with membership lists of the Association.  A long process, but necessary.  Only by doing this will you discover the trail of the killers, and destroy them all.Then a sudden warning comes through the comm; it looks like this party is about to warm up.  The bad guys have sent a fleet to destroy your 'convoy'.  You smile savagely, preparing to take off and deal with scumbags in orbit who have been trying to stop you from the minute you started looking successful.You send off a grim message packet to Olaf telling him to meet you on <DST> in the <DSY> system if you survive this little encounter...                                        1No desc reqd                                       cJust when you think that you are going to go insane hanging around this tinpot hole on the edge of nowhere, as you sit sipping your drink, a man comes over to you and tells you that they have managed to crack the crypto on the Databanks.  You quickly follow him into the Rebel HQ.As you arrive, the rebels' tactical computer, Horatio, is starting to deliver his analysis."The security leak is from cargo handler Jimrin Forge in the Tichel system.  I have linked him to the Bureau and the pirate group lead by Chade McGowan.  McGowan's fleets are evading us by using the Federation outposts to resupply."My assessment of the situation is that McGowan is in the direct employ of the Federation, and is controlled by the Bureau.  They supply him with the routes and times of Federation patrol sweeps.  This enables him to attack our fleets without fear of Federation intervention."It is my suggestion that the McGowan fleet be destroyed.  Removing him would decrease Federation intervention by 75%."McGowan, the man who stole your parents from you; McGowan, the man who has been killing your friends and associates without fear of retribution.  The rebels are discussing how best to destroy McGowan.  You on the other hand, have every intention of doing it first.  You can't let them take away your revenge.  Now is the time for blood.                                        1No desc reqd                                        1No desc reqd                                        1No desc reqd                                       7Just as you sit down you see a group made up of one man and two women, all with the soft, pallid look of scientists walk into the bar.  They remind you of the scientists from the terraforming team.  As soon as one of them spots you they all look in your direction and make their way over."Are you <PN>, Captain of the <PSN>?" asks one of the women, and when you nod in confirmation they all grin.  "Allow me to introduce myself, I'm Sarah Tanner, and we're from the Nirvana Terraforming and Stellar Engineering company, I believe you have worked with our company before?"When you slowly nod your head, they beam proudly."We have a proposal for you," Sarah continues brightly.  "Would you be interested in re-terraforming New Ireland?"You look at them incredulously for a moment.                                       ¸When you land you see an elderly looking brown-cloaked lady with gray hair hurry up your ramp and onto your ship.  Two gray-cloaked men who were flanking her stand at the bottom of the ramp as if guarding it."Bis Andreya!" exclaims Mu'Randa almost reverently, which causes you to look at her suspiciously.  "What has happened?""I am being followed by Federation troops," the old lady informs you both, "and I have no wish to be detained by them."At that moment you see a number of Federation soldiers begin entering the spaceport running towards your ship, and the two men in gray snap into action.  Within seconds they decimate the Federation forces in the most awesomely skilled and stunning display of martial arts you have ever seen.  When they finish with the soldiers they run back up the ramp and enter your ship."Young {G"man" "lady"}, I suggest that we get out of here before more of them turn up!" suggests Bis Andreya gently.  "Make for <RST> in the <RSY> system."                                       PThe ion damage from the pirates in the fleets has lead to a number of close calls, and it has been with luck rather than good management that you have made it this far.  The enemy you have faced have all headed straight for you, and you know that you will have to do something or there is every likelihood that the rest of the mission will end in disaster.  You are sitting on your ship-ramp when Tomak stops by."<PN>, I may have a solution to your dilemma," he offers tentatively, after you explain your thoughts to him.  "The pirates have been ionizing you, trying to disable you to make you an easier catch.  In exchange for my political asylum in the Rebellion, I brought along a prototype of an ion dissipation device.  If you would allow me, it wouldn't take too long to install it into your ship.  What do you think?"You consider for a moment, before realizing that having such a device couldn't hurt, especially when dealing with pirates and other groups that use ionizing technology.  You tell Tomak to go ahead.  A few days later, it is all ready to go. ˆ ˚Once more you are sitting in the bar when Frandall comes in.  He doesn't mince words."<PN>, are you able to do a special mission for me?"  He waits for you to nod. "Going back to Rauther Prime and picking up another shipment?"You groan, thinking about the trouble you had last time.  But Frandall goes on before you can protest too much."The last time you went to Rauther there was obviously a security leak, or somehow the Federation sent word to the Pirate organizations in the area that you were an inviting target.  We don't think the latter could have happened quickly enough to cause you as much trouble as it did, so we need to send you out again, in order to try and ascertain where the leak is."Are you game?"                                       IYou are in a state of total awareness the entire time you are on Rauther.  The loading of the "Engine Manifolds" takes very little time, but installing your new hardware is a trickier task.  Work can only progress while there is little chance of discovery by security patrols.Finally, the cannons are in place, and the tests have been run.  Your targeting computers recognize the weapon, and you are impressed at the size of the things.  Each side of your ship there is an innocuous little hatch, yet when you climb into the inner workings of the ship, you see the impressive expanse of accelerators, focusing crystals and powerplants.  You grin wickedly at the thought of taking your revenge on the scum that caused so much trouble on your last trip back to Rebel II.  Now you will have the whip hand.                                       ,You are sitting quietly in the bar, going over the latest reports from Olaf, when the man himself walks in.  He heads in your direction, and you are secretly relieved.  You never did have much time for paperwork, and all in all whenever Olaf heads your way, you know that you'll be headed off into the depths of space again.Olaf doesn't disappoint, and he tells you about a pirate outfitter organization operating out of <RST> in the <RSY> system, using a large asteroid as a base.  Apparently, they are building some very powerful engine upgrades out there, and are prepared to sell them to the highest bidder.  Olaf thinks it would be worthwhile heading out there and having a look at least."But just be careful," he finishes "They are apparently a pretty rough bunch."                                       	OOn arrival, you cycle the hatch, and see four burly men facing you, each holding a wickedly oversized blaster.  A skeletal man steps out from behind them, and starts rasping at you."Don't be causin' any trouble about he'er," in a thick and uncouth accent, "or you'll be dealin' with ma boys, Reggie, Ronnie, Mikki, and Rodger."  You nod to the four mutant apes, who grunt a monosyllabic greeting to you.You tell Skinny Man that you have been sent by Olaf Greyshoulders to view the engine upgrades for sale."Olaf," Skinny sneers "He be just ay'nutha uppity central boy.  He don't know jack about reel eng'ine work.  Always too busy stickin' he's nose where it aint wanted."  You bite back an angry retort, and ask the man if he has any upgrades available, and if so, how much does he want for them.The price has almost tripled since you left Viking.  You tell Skinny this, and he just laughs at you."Weeell," he drawls "You could pay us, or you could be doin' us a fay'vor.  Wee've been having tru'ble with a pirate over East." That would be 'Daring' Dan McGraw over in the Lalande 21185 system, you think to yourself. You've had some cordial dealings with him through the Association; last time you spoke him via subspace, Dan was having trouble with, as he put it, 'hicks' who decided that they would take resources from his territory, and attack him if he complained about it.  At least, that was Dan's version.According to Skinny, the real problem was that Dan didn't like his boys "takin' rides" in his systems, and that McGraw couldn't understand boys "just bein' boys" and "shootin' and drinkin' and blowin' stuff up".  You mutter your agreement, meanwhile thinking that Skinny is a true imbecile.However, when Skinny finally gets to the point, you have to stop and consider.  Skinny is prepared to throw in all of his engineering skills (while Skinny is a ferret, he has done some amazing things with engines) which will make your ship accelerate faster, fly at a faster top speed, and jump "like a Vell-os with a Nuclear Torp up it's butt".  You guess this means that it will jump quickly.However, in return, Skinny wants you to make his problems with McGraw "jus' dissapeer...if ya git ma drift..."So, do you do it or not?  You do have an "agreement" with McGraw regarding each other's shipping, and he's not a bad guy.                                       XLanding on Altia, you feel highly ashamed, but you have done the deed.  McGraw cursed you with his last words, and they still echo in your ears.  However, Skinny is more than happy to follow through with his end of the bargain, and soon you are ready to leave with the hottest ship you have ever seen.  Skinny has worked almost round the clock, and his boys have been enjoying their new found freedom.  Skinny even guarantees his workmanship, saying "It'll be a cold day on Sirius Prime before you have to work on these babies again."As you are leaving, a huge fleet of Pirate Vessels jump into system, and Skinny and the boys begin leaping with joy.  Apparently, the fleet belongs to the rest of Skinny's "Kin" and they will be having a huge party that night.  You decline the offer to stay, and head back to Viking.                                       ’You land on the asteroid, surprised at how empty it is.  You almost start to think that Skinny left with his "young'uns" when you hear him whistling away to himself down a long corridor.  You pull out your blaster, and wander in.  Skinny is elbows deep in the innards of an engine, and in no position to defend himself.  At first he is ropeable at being disturbed, but before long he is working on your ship.  By the time he has finished, you take him back to his workshop, hog-tie him, and go back to your ship.  But just when you think you are going to get away with it scot free, you hear Reggie (or was it Ronnie - they are all so alike) excitedly calling in on the radio saying "Paw, lookie at who we found!"You quickly turn on your sensors, and sure enough, the boys are coming back, with a fairly major Pirate raiding force following them.  You prep the ship for battle, and hope that Skinny wasn't smart enough to do anything foolish!                                        Looking around you notice a number of figures darting towards you, and you decide that it would be better not to hang around to find out what exactly they want.  Discretion being the better part of valor and all that...                                       3You are quietly going over some Association data, when there is a tap on your shoulder.  You turn, and Olaf slides his bulk gratefully onto a chair."Have you got a minute?"  he asks.  You nod and he waves for a drink.  "I've been approached by a friend of mine from the old association.  A scientist of sorts, but more interested in dabbling in a number of fields.  He would have been legendary if he had specialized, but he couldn't keep up the focus on one thing long enough."He has been working on a couple of small devices for us, and his work has snow-balled into a couple of major innovations in the fields of robotics and interstellar travel.  He's given us first chance to use his work for a practical purpose, because he has been unofficially on the payroll for so long.  His creations are currently incomplete, but he is sure we will be able to put them to good use, if we help him by collecting crucial resources for him."You ask Olaf to tell you what exactly he needs, and where you are supposed to get them.  He smiles, shaking his head."That's one thing I always liked about you <PN>, you never were one to beat around the bush.  The first resource you need to collect is a shipment of metal.  It's on <DST> in the <DSY> system.  Can you fetch it and return here with it."                                       {You wander into the bar to meet Olaf, and he waves you to a seat."<PN>, things are going well on the droid project, but the boffin now wants us to collect something else for him.  Only problem is, it hasn't been mined in 400 years.  The last ship to transport the stuff was called 'Ryan's Last Chance.'  A group of prospectors apparently found the wreck of a leviathan in the depths of space, and their leader, Ryan, had them spend years repairing it to return with its cargo to more civilized space.  Their last transmission was sent from the Don'U'Cusyon system, saying that the ship had been repaired enough to attempt the return leg, and listed their stock-take on the cargo, so they could get some market prices.  Unfortunately for them, they never arrived, and the ship faded from memory.  Now we need you to go and find it.  Are you interested?"                                       EYou meet Olaf in the Shipyard as he watches techs crawling over your ship.  He indicates the man directing them, "Dr. Ralph Sutherland.  The reason you've been flying all over the universe collecting various resources.  We are installing his inventions."The Doctor explains.  "This is the "Sutherland Warp Time Compressor."  It uses an energy field, created through the use of a forced matrix...""Doctor, you've lost me already," you interrupt, smiling.  "What does it do?""Oh, that's simpler," he grins.  "It reduces the amount of time you spend in warp space, by creating a better warp bubble"Olaf chimes in," Tell him about the droids."Dr. Ralph explains that his droids will repair your ship and themselves, even replacing droids lost in battle.  Repairs can be done in space, saving the need of landfall.You simply cannot tell Dr. Ralph how impressed you are with him, nor how his new tools will help you in your day to day encounters, and ask if you can do anything for him.He tells you his wife and two children are being held captive by the Federation to ensure his continued work for their Navy.You assure Ralph you can help.  Bribes are sent, papers produced, and soon you are ready to leave to collect his wife Denise and his children, Rodger and Jenny, from <DST> in the <DSY> system. +The small hunched man suddenly straightens and looks you straight in the eye."Captain <PN>," he says in stern tone, "I am an investigator for the Federation Ship Licensing Registrar, and you have just bought an illegal license.  The punishment for such a violation of our regulations is a fine that totals fifty percent of your known savings and a revocation of any other licenses you might have."In future," he continues dismissively, "I would suggest you think twice about flouting the rules."Have a nice day."                                       fThe Federation official sits down next to you and quietly tells you that the Aurorans have been getting more active along the Auroran/Federation border, and in doing so, they have actually caused a shortage of weapon stocks.  Your mission is to carry <CQ> tons of IR Missiles to <RST> to help them replenish their stores.                                       Æ"We have a shortage of Radar Missiles on <RST> in the <RSY> system.  The Federation has a stockpile of everything we need on the Kane Band in the <DSY> system.  We want you to go and pick up 20 tons of Radar Missiles and take it to <RST>.  Be warned, the Aurorans may have some knowledge of your activities from their spy network, so you might have to deal with some interference.  Good luck."                                       ["This time we have a shortage of the gas used to power many of our laser systems," he says.  "Simply put, all we want you to do is pick it up from the Kane Band, and then ferry it back here."However, once again, we believe that the Aurorans will be onto you, so I would watch yourself out there.  Good luck."                                       ¥"It seems that <RST> needs another shipment of IR missiles," he confides.  "I don't know how they are managing to go through so many so quickly, but they need another load, and they need it as soon as possible.  You know the drill, pick it up on the Kane Band, and deliver it to <RST>.  Watch out for Aurorans, they seem to be popping up everywhere at the moment.  Oh, and give my regards to Rabin."                                       Ω"This time we have a shortage of the IR missiles on <RST> in the <RSY> system," he says.  "Simply put, all we want you to do is pick it up from the stores depot on the Kane Band, and then ferry it over there."However, once again, we believe that the Aurorans will be onto you, so I would watch yourself out there."Rabin looks over his shoulder and leans a little closer."I should warn you about <RST>'s Chief Supply Officer," he cautions.  "His name is Calvert-Smythe; hyphenated name, very good family.  He affects some sort of superiority complex that includes a bizarre turn of phrase and a ridiculous accent.  Watch yourself around him, he's an odd one."                                       ê"That's the spirit!" he shrills offensively.  "It seems old Ffierra is running out of radar missiles, the poor blighter, and it is up to you to save the day, what-ho!"You are starting to feel a little bit like a cornered rat."Oh, and it seems that the Aurorans are getting on to you, old {G"chap" "girl"}," he continues painfully, "they seem to have assembled something resembling a small fleet to stop you.  Not that you would let a few pesky savages stop you from prevailing, eh?  Good work, {G"old boy" "lass"}.  A bit of adventure wouldn't you say.  Oh, what I would give to be out there, duelling with them, looking the savage in the eye and smelling the breath of the beast.  I say!  Smashing!"He shifts slightly, refocusing his attention on you."Anyway," he continues, his voice returning to a mere dull ache, "must dash.  Good luck, {G"old boy" "dear girl"}!"                                       ¨"A military team has captured a terrorist red-handed," she shifts her weight again, her chair whining in protest, "as she attempted to plant an explosive device near a suburban shopping center."They are currently located in <DST> in the <DSY> system," she continues gently, "and I want you to pick them up and return them here.  Nothing else."You are slightly nonplussed, and you cannot help but think that this is almost seems too easy.  She must have read your face as she continues pleasantly, "This one is easy, but don't make the mistake of thinking that any later ones will follow suit," she breathes.  "This one is just to get you 'into the groove', so to speak.  The real test will come later."You hear a squeal of metal on metal as she swivels her chair away from you."But don't get distracted," she continues dismissively, "I don't want you losing your focus from the mission at hand."                                       ç"By now you should have guessed that you are working for the Bureau of Internal Investigation," she shifts her weight again, her chair whining in protest.  "The reason I tell you this is to explain the reasoning behind your mission."We are a large organization, and consequently security is a problem," she continues gently.  "We are continually looking to plug leaks and we believe we have found one."Apparently a counter-intelligence team has apprehended someone hacking into high-security information," she breathes.  "They are currently holding this alleged spy on <DST> in the <DSY> system.  Same as last time, I want you to retrieve them."Another thing," she warns, "we believe that the pirate organization that calls themselves the Rebels have been sniffing around the planet, so watch yourself out there; I wouldn't want to lose you so early in the testing."                                       X"This mission is a little more delicate," she explains, shifting her weight.  "But, as I am sure you can understand, we at the Bureau have to look beyond the little people to the people behind them."Occasionally we get lucky," she continues explaining, "and we manage, by hook or by crook, to track down somebody who is surreptitiously raising credits to pay for the activities of our various enemies."Apparently a team of computer financial analysts managed to track down one such person by looking over his accounts and transactions," she breathes.  "So we sent in a counter-intel team to round him up and guess what?  They need to be retrieved.  Go to <DST> in the <DSY> system to pick them up."Once again," she warns, "I understand that the Rebels have been showing up in that area, so take care of yourself."                                       "Welcome to black-ops," she begins.  "This operation is highly classified.  It's only made legal because of our charter which gives us exceptional powers of arrest in times of emergency.  As you are probably aware, the Third Auroran War has never been declared over, because, in reality, while the battles in space are over we are now warring in the fields of politics and intrigue."We have arrested someone who is deliberately undermining our efforts in these areas," she continues explaining.  "His name is Faran Kurik, you may have heard of him."You remember something about him being a political activist on the news vids."We can link him to any number of enemy intel agencies," she breathes, "and in the last few weeks he has been calling into question our very charter.  We want to check him out thoroughly.  Go to <DST> in the <DSY> system to pick him up."Be warned," she says seriously, "we believe that he has ties with the rebels, and you can expect them to try to stop us from talking to him."                                       H"This is another black-op," she explains.  "But I am going to be sending you in blind.  I want to find out exactly where your loyalties are, and I can only do that by seeing how you react in the field."As usual, we want you to pick up a team and their prisoner," she continues calmly.  "They are on <DST> in the <DSY> system.  That is all I will tell you for now.  If you return here it will either be because you have proved your loyalties or because our enemies have destroyed us.  I know which one I am hoping for."Good luck, Captain <PN>."                                       –In a split second you make the decision to stay with the Bureau and you pull out your blaster and start firing into the back of the now smoke-filled room in order to allow the c-int team to get out.  From there two members of the team take charge of dragging the now unconscious councilor along while the rest of you lay down fire on anyone emerging from the bar.As soon as you get onto your ship you start to rush through your pre-flight routine as quickly as you possibly can, leaving out every non-essential item you can.As you work the leader of the c-int team comes forward to thank you for your help, "It was pretty hairy out there," she grins.  "The intel we got about how popular that guy was with his people was a little inaccurate."That comment makes you wonder if Krane had these guys deliberately duped in order to make you take a hand directly.'Oh well,' you think, 'that's one way of making someone prove themselves.'                                       Ì"What I want you to do," Krane continues, "is to head over there, do their bidding for a while and eventually get inside their organization.  We'll spread the rumor that you are on the run from us after trying to rescue the councilor.  That should be enough to get you started."If, during your travels," she shifts again, "you see a ship called the 'Prodigal Son', it'll be because we want to contact you.  Finish your current mission then come to the bar here and we'll go through the normal procedure.  Perhaps it would be best if you continually checked the Earth bar, in case you miss the 'Prodigal Son', or if we can't put it in your path."Go now to Rebel II in the Koria system," she orders with quiet authority, "and tell the rebels you want to aid them somehow, as the Bureau is not what you thought it was.  They will take it from there."Be careful, <PN>," she warns sincerely.  "I only just recently gained your services, I don't want to lose you now."                                       ‹"I rather thought I could count on you," he thanks you warmly, "but let's get down to business."The Polaris have been studying the capabilities of the Wraith," he explains quietly, "and, not long ago they figured out how to duplicate their 'cloaking' capabilities.  Now, despite the events that unfolded during their previous attempt to loan us some of their technology, they still seem to like us.  They allowed us access to their physics data on the subject, and some engineering information on how to use our current level of technology to recreate the effect in question."To cut a long story short," he summarizes, rolling his eyes, "after a few months of sitting down and just trying to figure out what they were talking about we set to trying to create a process to mass-produce cloaking devices for our own ships.  We've built the first one and we want it to be tested by a competent pilot who has the capability to get {G "himself" "herself"} out of trouble if something goes wrong."So I want you to head down to <DST> in the <DSY> system and then return here," he concludes with a smile.  "If you can avoid being scanned by the Feds, so much the better, if not, well, I suspect we'll manage." 5You are shepherded back into the room with a single spotlight facing the door and you cringe waiting for that beautiful voice to tear you apart."It seems I was right to have doubts about you," begins that lovely female voice.  "What's more you have already begun infiltrating the rebel organization for us.  Aren't you a wonderful little drone?"Her chair creaks as her weight shifts."What we want you to do," she continues, "is to continue with this infiltration.

Finish your current mission then go to the bar on Earth and ask for Commander Krane, you will then be brought to me.  Perhaps it would be best if you continually checked the Earth bar, in case you miss the 'Prodigal Son', or if we can't put it in your path."Now, you head back to <RST>, and continue as before," she finishes sweetly.  "I look forward to seeing you again soon, my dear."                                       ı"We're talking now about insertion missions," Jay continues quietly, "where you take an agent from here and plant them wherever they need to go to start their new lives as informants."Allow me to introduce Fiona," he indicates the woman next to him and you can barely bring yourself to look at her knowing that you will end up betraying her.  "She needs to get to Dunroamin in the Journey's End system.  The usual deal applies in keeping away from the Federation and the Bureau.  Good luck to the both of you."You manage to keep the anguish off your face and you carry on acting normally despite the loathing you feel for yourself.  You find yourself automatically plotting in a course to take her straight to <RST>.

"She needs to get to Dunroamin in the Journey's End system.  The usual deal applies in keeping away from the Federation and the Bureau.  Good luck to the both of you."You nod in agreement thinking that Krane will be more than happy to replace this young lady with a Bureau agent.  That way she can learn a lot more about the way these rebels operate.  You resolve to take her to <RST> straight away.                                       "Good," she continues in a business-like tone.  "I knew I could count on you."Obviously," she tells you with a casual wave, "I can't reveal to you any details of the coming operation for reasons of operational security, so you'll be going into this a little blind.  I'm sorry, but I'm sure you understand."You nod and indicate that she should continue."I want you to head down to <DST> in the <DSY> system," she informs you after referring to the map on her datapad.  "Have a quick look around, find out what you can about their current status politically, economically and militarily.  When you've given the place the once over, head back here and report to me."Any questions?" she asks.  "No?  Good.  Well, then good luck, Captain <PN>.  Have fun!"                                       ã"It's fairly simple really," she explains with a casual wave, "all you have to do is lead four ships down to the station '<DST>' in the <DSY> system.  While you're there cause as much damage as possible.  The ships going with you will be carrying a sizeable force of ground troops who will cause as much havoc as possible onboard the station."When the land commander, General Sutton, is satisfied that he has completed his mission," she continues cheerfully, "return here and we'll take things from there.  If things go as planned, I might need you to head back down there again almost immediately."Good luck!"                                       "Excellent!" she exclaims with a smile that lights up her beautiful face.  "The elders are under house arrest on <RST> in the <RSY> system.  Go down there and tell them that we are prepared make them an offer."Firstly," Krane ticks off a finger, "we are prepared to let them return to their former preeminence.  Secondly, we are prepared to help them eliminate the four other houses leaving them in complete control of Auroran Space."However, there is a catch," she continues with a sneaky grin.  "In return we ask that they become a vassal nation, not to the Federation, which they will never tolerate, but to the Bureau.  Tell them that we are willing to negotiate around the edges of these points, but if they aren't prepared to come to the table, then we are prepared to destroy them utterly and to reveal their severely weakened state to all of their rivals who will pick over them when we are finished."Any questions?" she asks quietly.  "No?  Good.  When you are finished, return here for further orders."                                       "Excellent," her dazzling smile lighting up her face.  "The message details how we want them to organize several Auroran military expeditions into Federation space.  At first this will be to supposedly 'gauge our strength', but following missions will supposedly be diversions to a main attack elsewhere."In reality," she explains quietly, "these raids will be made up of warriors not of the Moash House, and we will be informed ahead of time of their arrival and will be able to move entire fleets to meet them.  The end result will be four severely weakened houses which will be advantageous to both the Moash House and ourselves."The only reason I am telling you this," she warns meaningfully, "is because the Moash elders might not open the message pod correctly.  And if they don't its contents will be vaporized."Once you've delivered the message," she tells you as she stands, obviously preparing to leave, "return to <RST> and I will make sure that further instructions are left for you there."                                       H"Good," she continues with a smile.  "This message contains details on the next stage of our operation.  We want the Moash House to step up the raids into our space and begin amassing an armada of their own.  At a preordained time detailed in the message you will be carrying, a Federation force will be attacked by the Moash and destroyed.  Public opinion will be inflamed and war will be declared.  An enormous Federation fleet will head down into Auroran space in response and will begin running amok, but only selectively so.  The end result will be the destruction of the other four major houses.  Then the remaining survivor, the Moash House, will sue for peace, and we will grant it."Again, I am only telling you this," she reminds you seriously, "in case the Moash elders do not open the message pod correctly."Return to <RST> when you're done," she tells you dismissively.  You look over at the would-be suitor who stopped not far away, obviously not ready to give up.  "Don't worry about him," she continues quietly.  "He will be taken care of."                                       "I knew I could count on you," she smiles, revealing her perfect white teeth before continuing more seriously.  "Okay, here's the deal.  You are probably aware that there are elements within the government of the Federation that disagree with our actions and policies.  You probably do not know just how far it goes."A little over two weeks ago," she explains meaningfully, "the Federation President contacted the Rebels asking them to meet with him secretly.  I have a problem with this as it is a threat to security at levels that we will have difficulty controlling."From other sources I know that the Rebellion is very short on ships at the moment," she tells you quietly, "and if they want to move their leaders around in secret, they will need one that is not recognized by Federation security forces in any way.  That's where you come in."I want you to head back to <RST> in the <RSY> system," she informs you dismissively, "and reinfiltrate the Rebels to see if you can get in on these meetings."                                       4"I knew you could be counted on!" he exclaims and you smile, glad that he has no inkling about your true loyalties.  He continues with a grin.  "Basically, we want you to head up to <DST> in the <DSY> system to pick up a message pod.  While you're there you will be told where to take it.  The head-sheds weren't prepared to send that information to me in case it got intercepted."It should be a walk in the park for someone of your talents!" he laughs.  "Hell, if you can survive inside the Auroran Empire with all those warriors running around trying to kill everybody including each other, this should feel like a holiday!"You laugh appropriately, and the two of you finish your drinks before you take your leave of the muscular Jay and head back towards your beloved '<PSN>'.                                       µOn the way back to your beloved '<PSN>' you continue thinking about the situation of the Federation President.  You realize that if you were in his situation you would do the same thing.  After all, even though he is nominally in charge of the Federation, in reality now that the Bureau has taken over, he is little more than a figurehead for the masses to focus on.  You would feel sorry for him, but he is hampering Bureau plans to make all of humanity unite under one government, and so he must be taken care of.You casually go over your pre-flight checklist and prepare for yet another spaceflight and you coldly resolve to get to the bottom of this.                                       ‹"Thank you," he continues gratefully.  "I cannot tell you how important this mission is to us.  If this goes right, it may very well spell the end of the Bureau."Your ears pick up a little when you hear that.  You decide that this information is something you will have to pass on to Krane at the earliest opportunity."We want you to meet Dorraj at the same place you met him last time," Daniels explains, "and we want you to tell him the following message: 'Your office, Sol, four weeks'.  Did you get that?"You nod and your excitement grows as you realize that the rebels have set a date when they will be meeting with the President.  You decide that once you have delivered the message you will report to Krane immediately to pass on the information.  It could spell the end of the Rebellion and allow the Bureau to gain control of the President."Well good luck," Daniels continues, clapping you on the shoulder, "and once again thank you."                                       After leaving you twiddling your thumbs for a while, Commander Krane re-enters and sits back down behind her desk."I want you to go to the Rebel base in the <DSY> system, land and activate a homing beacon when you get there," she informs you brusquely.  "I will have a Carrier Group follow you, and several task forces waiting in nearby systems.  I have heard through other sources that the Rebel leaders will be going somewhere in the next few weeks, and I believe that they will be attending this meeting you warned us about.  So while the Rebels are without leadership I want to do as much damage as I can to their cause.  I want you to completely destroy one of their bases, and I will be trying to capture the Rebel leaders when they land on Earth.  While you're there, make sure that you destroy every rebel ship you can.  The weaker they are, the better."When the Federation soldiers have finished smashing the Rebel station," she finishes quietly, "return here for a debrief."                                       ©"Excellent!" Krane exclaims with a {G"stunning" "radiant"} smile before breathing a sigh of relief.  "We were getting a little worried when we couldn't catch you anywhere, and we are pushing hard up against the edge of our desired timetable."Like all the other missions down there," she explains offhandedly, "all we want you to do is take a message pod down to the House Elders.  When you're finished, return to <RST> for a debrief."While you're here," she continues quietly, leaning closer, "try to avoid getting scanned by Heraan ships.  From what we hear they are getting a little suspicious, and despite the protestations of our Moash allies, we don't believe that the Heraan warriors are either clumsy or inept.  If we can keep them in the dark until we start the operation, things will go a lot smoother."Good luck," she finishes with a smile.  "I'll see you when you get back to <RST>."                                       "Good!" she exclaims gratefully.  "The President is about to begin a three week holiday on <DST> in the <DSY> system.  We want you to go and have a chat with him."You see, over the next few days we are going to publicize the confessions of the former rebel leaders," she explains quietly.  "We want you to tell him that we have recorded them confessing to receiving contact from him.  We will make it look like he was making an attempt to increase his power by using them to weaken the Bureau and the military.  Make it clear to him that we are more than prepared to utterly discredit him if he does not do exactly what we tell him to do."Of course," she grins slyly as she continues, "make him aware that working for us won't be too difficult, as we won't be asking for much, but leave him in no doubt that if he makes any trouble we will put him away.  When you're finished, return here for a debrief."You chuckle, realizing that you are looking forward with interest to meeting the President again.                                       Ñ"Glad I can count on you," she breathes gratefully.  "We need our best operative on this one, it won't be easy."You will find the outer Polaris systems the toughest," she explains meaningfully, "because they have a warrior caste that seems to be in charge of running them, and they have no qualms whatsoever about shooting first and asking questions later.  Our best intelligence says that once you actually penetrate the perimeter of Polaris space, it should actually become easier."But to help you get past the first hurdle," she continues with a smile, "our technicians will fit a new experimental device to your ship called a 'cloaking device'.  It renders you invisible to the sensors of other ships.  Be careful using it because its startup sequence requires you to drop your shields and I doubt it will fool the Polaris for long.  Hopefully, though, it will be long enough for you to get through their outer defenses."When you get to their capital 'Kel'ar Iy'," she finishes quietly, "it will be up to you.  None of our agents have ever penetrated that far, so you will have to play it by ear.  Good luck."                                       "We are prepared to enter into an alliance with the Federation," she continues officially after receiving your nod of acquiescence.  "Our conditions would be that only one Federation diplomat be allowed into our space until the offer is accepted, with that number being increased to a maximum of five Federation diplomatic personnel once an agreement is reached.  In return, we ask that we be allowed to have full diplomatic compound on Earth staffed by personnel of our choosing."And finally, as a sign of good faith," she emphasizes meaningfully, "we are prepared, if the Federation agrees to our proposal, to allow a gradually increasing number of your young scientists to come to our training centers so that they can be taught the principles of our more advanced technology.  The timetable will be such that within one century, the technologies of the Polaris will be completely shared with the Federation."That is our offer," she finishes quietly.  "I ask that you present it to your superiors."                                       Ö"In that case," smiles Frandall slightly sardonically, "you are hereby given the diplomatic rank of '<PRK128>', with all the privileges and responsibilities inherent in that position.  You get a bigger salary and a bigger discount at Federation ports.  You will not be required to purchase any licenses any more either.  Enjoy it while it's yours..."But getting back to business," Frandall shakes his head in mild amusement, "although you will be technically a diplomat, we are more interested in the Polaris warrior caste, and especially with their Southern border."We want you to do two things," he continues with a sly grin.  "Firstly, we want you to confirm the location of the headquarters of the warrior caste.  We believe it is located to the galactic south-east of Kel'ariy."Secondly, we want you to have a look around the Polaris Southern border, the one they share with the Aurorans," Frandall tells you meaningfully.  "Land everywhere you can to get as much intelligence as possible.  Once you think that you have something that could be useful to us, return here for a debrief."Good luck '<SRK128>'."                                       ç"This mission should be fairly easy," Krane continues after you agree to take the mission.  "All you have to do is head back over to <DST> in the <DSY> system, pick up Bis Andreya and head back to <RST> in the <RSY> system."Try to keep her alive," says Krane meaningfully.  "The Bureau is at something of a disadvantage in this particular exchange, as it is one of the few times where we have relatively little control over events concerning the formation of Federation policy.  So if she dies while under the protection of a Bureau operative, we would struggle to contain the resulting media circus."Good luck."                                       "It will take the Polaris at least another week to receive the message about the death of their leader," Krane murmurs quietly, "and at least another week to marshal their forces for a major attack.  We need that time to begin marshalling our own forces to defend against them.  In that time we want you to head down to <RST> in the <RSY> system to meet up with the Auroran forces there."When you get there we want you to talk to Elder Kerachk," she continues explaining.  "He is the commander of the Auroran forces there that they have been building up for the last several months in preparation for the assault.""In essence," Frandall informs you succinctly, "we want you to lead the Auroran forces firstly to the home-world of the warrior caste and then on to their battle HQ.  Once you have done that, return here as quickly as possible, for undoubtedly we will need your skills to help us emerge triumphant in the coming conflict."Good luck," Frandall finishes formally, "all our plans rely solely on you."                                       cYou watch Kerachk's face for some hint of how he is taking your news with increasing apprehension until he laughs a sudden brutal laugh and slaps the table."We will launch against the physical and spiritual hearts of the Polaris defenses?" he asks and you nod in confirmation.  "This will be a worthy battle!  I will send ten of my best ships with you to learn the route, and once we know the way, we will launch ourselves upon these mysterious Polaris, and we shall see if we are ready to measure ourselves against them!  And to think, we will be led into battle against the Polaris by the '<PRK>'.  Who would have thought it?  Surely this is an omen that the time to strike is NOW!"The warriors in the bar all raise their drinks at this last shout and salute the coming battle, with many of them uttering battle cries.You tell Kerachk that you will be prepping your ship for flight as soon as possible."My men will be ready when you are!" he tells you gleefully.  "You will be the first Federation '<SRK>' to have ever had the honor of leading the Auroran Empire into battle!"                                       ¡"Thank you," she smiles gratefully.  "Like I said, they will be in the Tichel system soon, so meet them there.  They have to be destroyed before they can go any further."If you make it through," she finishes dismissively, "you will find me on <RST>, and, if you make it, we will finally be able to give you a full debrief on your last few missions."Good luck <PN>," Krane shakes your hand, "come back alive."                                       Ü"I knew that would appeal to your sense of natural justice," she continues ironically.  "Well, when you are ready, if we could get to the President's offices on Earth, we can get this circus started."Just keep an eye out for Federation ships in the Sol system," Krane warns you quietly.  "We believe that he has been trying to gather around him troops loyal to him directly, so we cannot trust the commanders of any Federation Naval ships around Earth at this time."After hearing all this you quickly down your drink and the two of you head back to your beloved '<PSN>' to begin your quick journey to Sol.                                       b"All right then," he says squaring his shoulders, "if you could go to <DST> in the <DSY> system and pick up <CQ> tons of <CT> and bring it back here, it would be much appreciated.  Ask for Jay when you return, and I'll make sure it gets distributed to the right people."When you're on <DST>," Jay continues, "make sure you get your produce from a guy named Burton.  He's willing to sell his food to people he hasn't seen before so he's your man."You thank him sincerely but he merely eyes you askance, leaving you wondering what you did wrong.  He must have read your face because he goes on to say, "Next time," he warns picking up his drink, "don't bring everyday business to the bar.  I like my time off."You nod your head and start heading back to your beloved <PSN> leaving Jay to savor the rest of his drink in peace.                                       y"Well, it's pretty simple really," Jay continues expansively.  "No different to what you are doing now, except that the Bureau now reckons that what you will be smuggling is worse than what you were smuggling before."All we want you to do is to go to <DST> in the <DSY> system," he indicates with a casual wave of his arm, "get <CQ> tons of <CT> and bring it back here."Jay leans forward again.  "The man to go and see about getting this stuff no questions asked is a guy named Arpad.  He knows his work and is very competent.  He'll make sure you're looked after."Good luck, Captain <PN>."                                       "In reality this mission is fairly simple," Jay continues quietly, "not too different from the cargo missions you have been doing, except that you will be picking up a passenger rather than freight."The lady in question, whose name is Anna, lives on <DST> in the <DSY> system," he tells you seriously.  "Make sure you aren't spotted on the way out as the Bureau would really like it if they stumbled onto a Rebel extraction."Jay leans forward to emphasize his next point, "The Rebellion prides itself on looking after its people when it can.  You are now an integral part of that idea.  Our leaders have made a vow to extract any agent in trouble if it is possible without further compromising security.  It is one of the things that allows the Rebellion to employ so many people, otherwise many would simply not pluck up the courage to join, and we would be struggling even more than we are.""I leave it in your capable hands," he leans back confidently.  "Good luck, Captain <PN>."                                        ‹Message to:  Captain <PN>Message from:  JayI have been informed that another agent needs extracting.  He is located on <DST> in the <DSY> system.  Return him to Merrol.Good luck!                                        You cannot stand it any longer.  You head towards Jay's office with people staring at you because of the tears in your eyes.You walk in and he looks up in alarm.  He immediately gets up and closes the door behind you."What's wrong?" he asks as he puts a hand on your shoulder.You collapse on the floor as you realize that you CANNOT tell him.  Your conditioning prevents you."I... I don't understand," Jay stumbles, unsure of himself.You reach up and part your hair just above your ear revealing the surgical scar from your implant.  He understands immediately.He reaches down and with surprising strength lifts you to your feet."We have people who can help you," he tells you urgently, "but you have to go to <DST> in the <DSY> system, you will be taken care of there.  Don't worry, I'll send two ships with you for protection."You stare at him dumbfounded."Hurry!" he roars at you suddenly angry.  "How much time do you think you have before they discover you've been turned and set off the device?"                                       Ω"We're talking now about insertion missions," Jay continues quietly, "where you take an agent from here and plant them wherever they need to go to start their new lives as informants."Allow me to introduce Fiona," he indicates the woman next to him.  "She needs to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system.  The usual deal applies in keeping away from the Federation and the Bureau.  Good luck to the both of you."                                       œYou read the short message from Jay and go to the appointed place and await your passenger.  You don't think you could have picked a more ordinary-looking guy for the job.  As you do with all of the rebel agents you wonder what his story is, but you know better than to ask.He tells you that he needs to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system and you take him to your ship and immediately get stuck into your pre-flight checklist.                                       “"I don't know what they want you to do," Jay continues seriously, "I've been told that you have to report to <RST> in the <RSY> system, and that's it."He leans forward on his enormous arms."Just be careful with the spooks," Jay says carefully.  "I'm sure that they all have the best of intentions, but I get the feeling that the longer a person spends manipulating other people and learning to live several different lives, the more it warps their perceptions.  I don't think there's a spook out there that doesn't go a bit weird after a while.  And look out for that Frandall guy.  He'll come across as a decent sort of bloke, but I've never met anybody who is more willing to sacrifice anything to achieve his aims.  To him we are all pawns to be moved about in an enormous chess game.  None of us matters as long as he wins."But good luck anyway," he thumps you on the arm.  "It'll sure beat the hell out of carting freight around."                                       Ú"Excellent!" Geoff exclaims.  "We needed someone with the ability to handle themselves in a tight situation," he continues earnestly, "as well as being completely trustworthy.  You would be surprised how small that list actually is.  Especially when you factor in availability and the conspicuous nature of most of our ships.  You came out near the top of all our list, and you were the only person to do that in every category."The Polaris have gotten a message to us asking us to send someone to them.  They were pretty vague on what the meeting was actually going to be about, but we cannot afford to let slip any chance at gaining another technological edge over the Bureau.  When we got the Dragons, they were a godsend.  Even if it is only to foster better relations with them, we cannot afford not to go a little out of our way to accommodate them."So we want you to go to <DST> in the <DSY> system," he concludes decisively, "to find out what the Polaris want."                                       ˇ"In essence your supervisor is correct," states Mu'Randa.  "But we do not want the Federation at this stage to know that we are involving ourselves even peripherally in your struggle, so do try to avoid being scanned by them.  I doubt that the Ruling Council will decide to allow the Rebels the use of the holo-scanning technology if you fail, but regardless, I need to get back to <RST> in the <RSY> system.  Once we arrive I will go to advise the Council on what has happened and I will meet you in the bar there to inform you of the Council's decision one way or another.  So even if we are detected by Federation vessels, if you could proceed to <RST> and await me in the bar for the final word, it would be much appreciated."                                       ì"Now we have to go to <DST> in the <DSY> system," she continues cheerfully.  "I will be going along with you so that I can introduce you to avoid any misunderstandings.  Not that many Polarans actually understand Basic, so I will also serve as a translator."So when do we leave?" she asks brightly.You down the remains of the almost revoltingly wholesome Polaris drink they serve here and the pair of you start heading back to your beloved <PSN>.  Despite the incredibly advanced Polaris ships around her, possibly because of it, never before has she shone quite so well.  You step inside feeling enormously satisfied.                                       Ì"It shouldn't be too hard for someone of your piloting abilities," he asserts confidently.  "Just fly around Federation Space landing on planets and stations until you start getting some anomalous readings.  Once you've done that, come back here and we'll get our techs to see if they can understand all the technobabble and we'll take it from there."He leans back and rubs his tired-looking eyes."I don't need to remind you," he states languidly, "that we don't want the Federation to become aware of the technology we now have.  Otherwise we will lose half the advantage it gives us.  So if you could stay out of the path of their warships, it would be appreciated by everyone in the intel side of things."                                       Ü"Excellent," he exclaims happily.  "In reality it is very simple.  We want you to head down there and have a look around.  While you're there, land on <DST> and see what you can find out.  Once you've done that, return here for a debrief."Don't spend too much time out there," he warns in a slightly odd tone.  "I'm getting the feeling that things are starting to come to a head.  I believe that we are beginning to stumble onto the edges of something big that the Bureau has been putting together for a while.  If I'm right, they might not like an outsider nosing around.  Take care of yourself out there."                                       —"They are a mercenary outfit operating out of <DST> in the <DSY> system," he explains.  "They are the main reason why the Federation has allowed <DST> to remain independent even though it is completely surrounded.  Not that the Federation is above using them to shore up their defenses; they are currently being employed to man Spacedock VI.{b818 "He stops, looking a little annoyed as you start smiling.\"Something amusing?\" he asks after a moment, and you explain some of your history with the Wild Geese.\"Oh,\" he grins, looking a little sheepish, \"you won't have to hear the rest of the info on them then!\"" "\"Apparently there is some history between the leader of the Wild Geese, Eamon Flannigan, and Admiral Raczak,\" General Smart explains further, \"and Geoff believes that seeing that Admiral Raczak seems to be in charge of this invasion, the Wild Geese might be prepared to help us when the time comes for action."}"{b818 "Well then" "In essence"}," he {b818 "concludes, smiling" "continues earnestly"}, "we want you to go down to <DST> in the <DSY> system to talk to Eamon Flannigan to find out what he wants in return for the aid of his forces in the coming troubles."                                       ˆ"{b10 "\"Seeing as you have actually opened a chapterhouse for the United Shipping corporation,\" Geoff muses, \"you should be familiar with the way the Aurorans do things.  Good luck.\"" "Okay,\" Geoff continues, \"a little background so you know what you are getting yourself in for.\"Firstly,\" he begins earnestly, \"the Aurora system is several jumps south of the Tichel system.\"The Empire itself is more like a loose confederacy of five major houses,\" he explains, \"than a true Empire.  It is ruled over by a Ruling Council made up of three representatives from each house and the Emperor, who comes from the 'first house', and he or she has the only veto vote.\"The first family changes from time to time,\" he continues dryly, \"and the current first house is the Moash house who have demonstrated that they are capable of underhanded dealings.\"However,\" he says, grinning, \"just because Moash is the first house doesn't mean that they are immune from attacks by the other houses.  In fact far from it, the Moash house is probably attacked more often than any other house.  In fact, such violent acts are an integral part of Auroran politics.\"He sits back still smiling.\"Doesn't it all sound like fun?\""}                                       d"I want you to know that I really appreciate this," he says sincerely.  "Now I need to tell you a few things to help you survive this mission."Firstly," he explains seriously, "the Auroran warriors have a custom of challenging newcomers to their worlds to a duel.  Don't try to engage them in hand-to-hand combat.  They train for years in those disciplines.  If they attack you, shoot them, and shoot to kill.  Maiming is bad form and will cause others to join the fight.  A clean death is much more honorable."Secondly," he continues tiredly, "don't get into a verbal joust with them.  They respect doers of deeds and dislike speakers of rubbish."Other than that," he concludes running his hand through his hair, "just keep your eyes open.  They have a habit of jumping on you from unexpected angles.  Good luck down there."                                       "Excellent!" he exclaims happily.  "We need to alert these people so they can prepare for the coming events.  The 'Wild Geese' have to be ready to jump in and save Raczak's backside, otherwise a war will be started.  We need to warn the Heraan House as they, being the hated enemy of the Moash House, are most likely to bear the brunt of the first invasion force.  They are also the most reasonable of the major houses so they might actually listen.  If you can get Flannigan along with that part of the mission, it will make things a lot easier.  If not, you will have to do it on your own."Finally," he continues quickly, "I want you to warn the Rimertan warriors as they are the only group of warriors that are trusted implicitly by Auroran courts.  Their testimony is as law, and if we can get them to witness Moash complicity in this matter, then the whole Auroran Empire will be thrown into turmoil."When you are finished, return here," he finishes simply.  "Any questions?  No?  Then good luck, my friend."                                       Ø"Of course," he continues, " you aren't an Auroran warrior which is a count against you, but the Heraan leaders are more open-minded than most and they realize that most Auroran warriors couldn't even hope to have done half the things you have."The real test will be when we see the Rimertans," he muses thoughtfully as you reach your ship.  "They like to keep themselves above what they think of as the petty squabbles between the Houses.  If they think that you are here representing the Heraan House they won't even see you.  I must admit that having me alongside you won't much help with that."Unfortunately," he muses sardonically, "unless you are a warrior, or have been introduced by a warrior they would probably ignore you anyway.  To them their lot is to fight and die with absolute honor.  In many ways they are the essence of being an Auroran warrior.  But dealing with them can be tricky."                                       Ë"The more time I spend with you," Eamon chuckles, "the more I like you.  I've never met anyone who can say so much by saying so little.  I wish I had your gift with words sometimes."You snort derisively as you set about preparing your ship for take-off.  He laughs."I can see why Frandall used you on me," he comments laughing.  "You and he come from a similar mold.  But then it's not surprising you take after him.  After all he is your supervisor."You manage stop the surprise you feel from reaching your face.  Frandall your supervisor?  The more you think about it, the more it makes sense.  Nobody has ever seen Frandall, nobody knows his name and yet Geoff/Frandall seems to have the ability to set his own missions for his own operatives.  He can also disappear at any time to take care of things and has the pulling power to get General Smart to pass on messages for him.You vow to have a few words with your 'supervisor' when you report back in.                                       ¥"You underestimate the abilities of the people you are working with," he says quietly.  "Now that we are forewarned and forearmed the Federation and the Bureau will be hard pressed to salvage a bloody draw out of the coming battles.  Wait and see."You down your drink in one long swallow before standing up, indicating you are ready to go."Yes," rumbles Eamon with a small smile, "it is time to head home to ready ourselves for war.  I need to return to <DST> and you need to return to whatever Rebel base to report in I would imagine."The two of you make your way back to your beloved <PSN> where he helps you to go through your pre-flight routine.                                       ˛"Excellent!" exclaims General Smart.  "We believe that without leadership the Bureau will take as much as a week to start re-organizing and the Federation Navy will be effectively broken up into a large number of smaller units that we will be able to deal with.""The head of the Bureau currently goes by the name of Krane," Frandall informs you, "and she is usually seen in the uniform of a Federation Navy commander.  She is mid-thirties, 5'5", slim with blonde hair and blue eyes."General Smart turns to stare at Frandall, "I wasn't aware that we knew that much about the leader of the Bureau.""She was my best pupil," reminisces Frandall.  "But she always did prefer to club things to death when a more surgical solution would suffice.  Finesse was never her strong point."Anyway," he continues, snapping out of his reverie, "she has been seen recently in the 'Wolf 359' system travelling in a ship called the <SN>.  Go there, disable her ship, capture her and return here." "It is simple really," he explains slowly.  "The Vell-os are telepaths.  It appears that there is a way for another telepath to take the strain leaving the Vell-os free from the burden of their enslavement."Now I just happen to know that the Polaris have a number of telepaths amongst them," he continues with a savage glint in his eye.  "None are anywhere near as powerful as any Vell-os, but a small group of them should be able to do the job.  That's where you come in.  I've already contacted the Polaris in the matter and they have agreed to help in the matter as they feel that they have an enormous debt to the Vell-os for protecting them from a Colonial Council invasion some seven centuries ago."Once you come back from <DST> in the <DSY> system with those Polaris telepaths," he says with a sudden cold resolution, "we can take the young Krane to trial and the Bureau will be no more."You realize that this cold, hard man before is the real Frandall whom you are seeing for the first time.                                       "I knew I could count on you," he continues gratefully.  "You are going to be escorting the ship <SN> to <RST>.  It will be carrying the Polaris telepaths and Dr. Pentecost.  General Smart is currently busy off on his crusades harassing the Federation forces but he assures me that he will meet you on Sol."Don't mention to Krane that we have a card up our sleeves," he tells you more seriously.  "We don't want her to suspect anything."It would be something of a public relations disaster," he says with a wry grin, "to lose Dr. Pentecost, the Polaris telepaths and the trial of Miss Krane all in one hit.  So if you could make sure that the <SN> isn't destroyed en route, it would probably be for the best."Good luck, Ory-Hara."                                       	"Thank you," he says gratefully, "I don't know how we would have survived without you."The remainder of the leaders are located on <DST> in the <DSY> system," he informs you.  "By the time you have left I will have sent them a coded signal warning them to be ready to return with you to Earth to lend their weight to the announcement.  It shouldn't be too hard unless the Bureau tries to interfere."While you're out there keep an eye out for Bureau forces," he continues.  "If you see any make sure you pass the information on to the next Rebel ship you see.  I believe most of them have been named <SN>, unless they have recently changed their paint-jobs."Good luck Ory-Hara," General Smart says standing, "and once again thank you."                                       ıYou answer in the affirmative, but you are not put off so easily.  You ask what she meant by Frandall starting the Rebellion."He is no better than that Krane woman," Mu'Randa answers, slightly cross at having to answer, "which is not surprising since she learned her craft from him.  He saw that when she was put in charge of the Bureau that he would be slowly pushed out of his job in Federation Intel.  So, in an effort to regain his influence, he began to subtly make sure that several influential people began to get access to information detailing atrocities committed by the Bureau.  The end result is that he has now destroyed his rival and has once again become the Head of Federation Intel.  You can be assured that we will be watching carefully while he remains in office."Enough of talking about that man!" Mu'Randa exclaims more cheerfully.  "You have proved yourself worthy of your name once again Ory'hara, and we would be honored if you could take us home."                                       k"Now we have to go to <DST> in the <DSY> system," she continues with a small smile.  "I will be going along with you so that I can introduce you to avoid any misunderstandings.  Not that many Polarans actually understand basic, so I will also serve as a translator."So when do we leave?" she asks more cheerfully.You down the remains of the wholesome Polaris drink they serve here and the pair of you start heading back to your beloved <PSN>.  You feel like you have somehow avoided serious failure.  You suddenly realize that you feel ashamed to have succeeded in this fashion.                                       ¶"Good value," General Smart pats you on the shoulder, handing you a datapad.  "We will program into your ship's computer the necessary security codes to land in the restricted area of the Kane Band owned by Sigma Shipyards.  Once there, access a general terminal and hook it into this datapad.  It should access the required information.  Once you have done that, we need you to take the datapad to <RST> in the <RSY> system for the gained information to be accessed."Hopefully it should be smooth sailing," he finishes mildly, "but all the same, avoid Federation patrols if you can."Take care Ory-hara, I'll see you on the flip-side..."                                        You answer in the affirmative, but you are not put off so easily.  You sense her disquiet, but you nonetheless ask what she meant by Frandall starting the Rebellion."He is no better than that Krane woman," Mu'Randa answers, slightly cross at having to answer, "which is not surprising since she learned her craft from him.  He saw that when she was put in charge of the Bureau that he would be slowly pushed out of his job in Federation Intel.

"You have proved yourself worthy of your name once again Ory'hara, and I would be honored if you could take me home."                                       ‰"I knew I could count on you," he continues gratefully.  "You are going to be escorting the ship <SN> to <RST>.  On board will be Dr. Pentecost.  He wants to be there when Krane is humiliated.  So does General Smart, but he is currently busy off on his crusades harassing the Federation forces but he assures me that he will meet you on Sol."Don't mention to Krane that we have a card up our sleeves," he tells you more seriously.  "We don't want her to suspect anything."It would be something of a public relations disaster," he says with a wry grin, "to lose Dr. Pentecost, so if you could make sure that the <SN> isn't destroyed en route, it would probably be for the best."Good luck Ory-Hara."                                       Ú"I thought that you might be," he smiles happily.  "She has been seen flying in and out of the Wolf 359 system in a ship called the '<SN>', no doubt going to and from the Bureau HQ there.  It should be a simple matter for one as skilled as yourself to disable her ship and capture her.  I'm sure your leaders in the Rebellion would be more than happy to have 'Miss Krane' in custody."You thank him, saying that you are overwhelmed by the more than generous sharing of information.  You tell him that you are happy to consider the debt paid."We do not think so," Llyrell responds quietly.  "We will remain in this universe for a while longer, for without us, 'Krane' will never be put away."Good luck, Ory'hara." º"Now that we know how to take the strain off the mind of a Vell-os," Mu'Randa goes on to explain, "we can now remove the enslaving device from one.  You see the Vell-os have been ordered to stop anyone from removing the devices, so if we can just take the load off one, we should be able to remove the machine from them."We don't know how to free all the Vell-os," she informs you quietly, "but the mental powers of the Vell-os are incredible.  Once we have freed one, that one may well be able to free others, who would in turn free others.  In no time at all, they would all be free."For now though," she tells you seriously, handing you a small hypodermic syringe, "we need you to capture a Vell-os for us and bring him or her back here.  In that syringe is a powerful sedative which should keep the Vell-os unconscious for several weeks, use it to keep the Vell-os from attempting to stop you from freeing him."                                       Ù"Well done!" exclaims Mu'Randa from behind you.  "You probably do not know it but you are the first person to have ever defeated the 'fatal convergence'.  It is a sequence of weaves by two people that will always defeat a single opponent unless that single opponent deliberately puts {G"him" "her"}self in a terrible position whereby the sequence is avoided, but {G"he" "she"} is still likely to be defeated by other means.  It is a saying amongst the Nil'kemorya, I believe, that only one who has Ory'hara could defeat it."The two Nil'kemorya nod in confirmation."Anyway, enough of this warrior testing," she continues, deliberately eyeing the two Nil'kemorya.  "The Council has agreed to help you.  We have a theorized a way of freeing a single Vell-os from enslavement.  I want to go to <RST> in the <RSY> system to observe the final stages of the experimentation."You ask if the two warriors will come along as well."Sure," Mu'Randa replies, surprised, "why not?"                                       "I thought you might agree," he eyes you curiously.  "I keep getting the feeling that your martial studies are starting to give you a much deeper awareness of what is going on.  It's almost as if you can somehow avoid the undercurrents of life that the rest of us get stuck in all too often."You allow a small smile to drift across your face as you observe the weaves of deep suspicion surrounding him.  The more you observe Geoff, the closer you get to understanding his true nature.  You feel that soon you will be able to see past the subtle mask he uses to hide his real identity."Anyway," he continues with thoughtfully narrowed eyes, "your skills mean that you are perhaps the most capable of my operatives to complete this mission.  I have already made contact with the Polaris and they know that you're coming, and they want you to meet them on <RST> in the <RSY> system."He looks at you shrewdly, saying after a short pause, "I'd wish you luck, but I get the feeling that you won't be needing it."                                       ˇAfter a short walk he leads you into his private apartment and invites you to sit down."There is a way to free us from our servitude," he tells you without preamble.  "Unfortunately, my people were explicitly ordered not to reveal or to act on any method that would lead to our freedom."You are a little horrified and ask who gave you this order."The Sol representative to the Colonial Council in the year 558NC," he replies calmly.  You shake your head stunned; that order was given nearly seven centuries ago!  The Vell-os nods in agreement with your unspoken outrage.  "I can give you only one clue.  Seek out the people we helped before our war.  I'm sorry I cannot be more specific, but I am a slave with his orders."You sigh in resignation and ask him if he can show you something of the Vell-os martial arts, and he looks pleased at the suggestion.  Over the next several hours the two of you spar and meditate as he guides your new sixth sense towards greater awareness.                                       "Let's ignore the morality of the situation for now," General Smart glares at Geoff, "and let's look at it tactically.  We are hopelessly outnumbered and the only reason we have survived is because we have kept our locations secret.  The Federation now knows of this base, and it is only a matter of time before they send an armada against us.  So we need to distract them.""That's where the Vell-os come in," explains Geoff.  "They form a loose, floating reserve which the Federation Navy can call upon at any time.  Without them, the Federation would have to use every spare ship in a mobile ready reaction force to be ready to deal with any emergency.  The end result, they couldn't wipe us out because they would be spread too thinly."Trouble is," General Smart adds, " we have no idea of how to free the Vell-os, so we want you to go and have a word with the one who is posted to Kane University in Sol.  Find out what is required.  When you've got an answer, come back here and we'll get the ball rolling."                                       ¶You watch Eamon leave before downing the last of your drink.  You look over at the two other rebel pilots who came along as well.  They seem to be waiting for some sort of signal from you.  You indicate with your head that it is time to go."Yes {G"sir" "ma'am"}," they both reply respectfully, and you realize that they view you as one of their leaders.  You almost laugh.  Who would have thought that a small-time hack freighter pilot would have ended up becoming a leading figure in the Rebellion and making not only contacts but life-long friends and allies throughout the galaxy.When you get back into the familiar cockpit of your beloved <PSN>, you quickly prep her for flight.  Almost before you know it you are heading out into hyperspace.You slip into your exercises without thinking, and you while away the endless hours of travel fighting increasingly talented imaginary opponents.                                       "I think that it would be best if you dropped Raczak back first," Eamon tells you, "and then you can continue on to New Ireland.  I think by then you will be ready to strike out on your own, as I think that I will have taught you everything that I can."You ask what he meant by that, as you do not yet feel that you have even gotten close to his level of skill."Don't denigrate the level you have achieved," he warns with a smile.  "You are already better than most Heraan warriors.  But I think that your skills lie in a different direction to mine.  You need to find something other than the Heron style.  I'll think on it as we train on the way."You shrug and indicate that the three of you should head towards your ship to prepare for the journey.                                       Eamon gives you a wink after Techerakh leaves and the noise in the bar returns to its normal level."The elders of the Heraan House feel themselves to be indebted to you personally," he tells you quietly.  "They will remain so until they have individually saved your life.  They were a little worried about me taking you for a student, but I am a heron master, they have no say in the matter.  They also realize that they have no right to censure me over teaching someone who saved their entire house from destruction."In the meantime I have found Raczak," he continues earnestly.  "He is currently fighting a rearguard action for survival in the Heraan Astra system.  The elders believe that the remnants of the Moash Fleet are still trying to destroy him in his flagship, the <SN>, in a final effort to pull the Federation into a war."What say we head off and rescue the poor soul," Eamon chuckles, "and then we'll return here to pick up everyone else.  Besides, I want to work you over some more." "In the mean time," he continues, "I'm going to start recalling my men. The amount of time and effort we would have to spend to cause significantly greater levels of damage are enormous, so we may as well pull out now.  Once my men start returning are we right to begin loading back on your ship?"You nod, saying that you have no problem with that.  You lever yourself up off the barstool saying that you will be waiting on board for his signal that he is ready to go.You settle into your cockpit with practised ease and get your beloved <PSN> ready to head back out into space again.  You start feeling a curious sense of apprehension about your coming lessons with Eamon, but you shake it off, concentrating on the job at hand.                                       2"Okay," Geoff continues, "a little background.{b818 "\"The Rebellion doesn't have too many ground troops,\" he explains, \"and for this operation we are going to need some, as I don't think that the Moash are going to be too worried about losing a few ships.  If we destroy their capital as well, that would be another story." "\"The Wild Geese are mercenaries,\" he explains.  \"The only loyalty they have is to themselves and their home planet, <DST>.  Their leader Eamon Flannigan has been initiated as a Heraan warrior and retains strong ties with them.  He has a heron tattooed on his face signifying he is a master of the Heron style of martial arts.  Only four heron masters are known to exist, so in unarmed combat he is virtually unstoppable.\"We need some more people to help out with the operation,\" he continues explaining.  \"Mainly ground troops, as I don't think that the Moash are going to be too worried about losing a few ships.  If we destroy their capital as well, that would be another story."}"Basically," he concludes, "I want you to go down to <DST>, talk to Eamon about borrowing a few Wild Geese then head down to <RST> and smash their capital.  When you're finished you might want to take a side trip to Heraan before returning here."Good luck, Ory-Hara."                                       ∞"Essentially this mission is very simple," Geoff continues quietly.  "Head down to <DST> in the <DSY> system and warn them that things are about to get a little uncomfortable.  Feel free to share with them everything we've learned about the coming events, but avoid telling them how we came by the information."If you get a chance," he says holding up a hand to emphasize his point, "find out what we can do to help.  I get the feeling that things are about to start spiralling out of control, and the more people we can count as our allies the better off we will be."Good luck out there Ory-Hara," he finishes sincerely.  "Take care of yourself."                                        ∫"Good.  I see you're not as spineless as you look.  If you'll come with me now, I'll supervise the loading of your cargo ...to ensure its integrity."                                        ì"You know the deal by now.  These are important supplies, riskier with the renewed Moashi forces.  Good luck."                                        ÿ"Good.  It is important that you are wary, as House Moashi dogs will try to intercept them.  They are the cause of our predicament, but not for long.  Oh no, not for much longer."                                       ”"It is a simple task.  By using simple civilian ships, we have amassed enough weapons for our reserves at Dominance to break the Moashi blockade from the inside out.  {b800"We have given you this mission out of our respect for your skills as a member of the Wild Geese, but it is also a test.  Your efforts will be noted" "This, because of your runs.  Thank you!  Don't think that House Heraan hasn't noticed your fine service"}."                                       õ"Before you may take your place amongst us, you must prove yourself worthy of the honor of becoming a warrior.  Go to the Laok system and battle the other would-be warriors that wait for you there.  Before you return here you must defeat them all - don't worry, they all have escape pods, we want this to be non-lethal.  They will try to disable you, it is the Auroran way." § âKuron leads you along the higher paths of the arcology, and you talk as you walk."<PN>," he begins, "all warriors of the House must be capable of holding their own, and no warrior can do so with poor equipment.  As a fully-fledged warrior, you are now allowed, and expected, to arm yourself with as much equipment as you believe you need to make yourself into a deadly weapon for the Heraan cause.  Some things will still be denied from you until you prove yourself worthy, but most of our ships are now yours to buy."On the subject of re-making yourself into a deadly weapon," he continues quietly, "all Heraani warriors are expected to be at least familiar with the martial arts.  I know that you can punch and kick without causing yourself permanent damage{b7880 ", and even though you are a Cunjo Hunter," ", but"} I'm afraid that the clumsy flailing that you call fighting will not do.  You must go to an old friend of mine.  He might seem a little grumpy, but he's a decent soul.  Just don't upset him or he may send me back your body parts to inform me that I should not have wasted his time.  You have potential, so you shall see him.  He chooses not to live amongst us but is an honored Heraan warrior.  Go to <RST> in <RSY> system;  I shall send word.  He will be expecting you.  Once he is satisfied with your progress, return here, for we will need your skills..." S"Let me guess," you "I'm the 'someone' to pick him "If only it were that simple, <PN>.  I can't tell you where Bazara is other than in the galactic north of Federation space," Kuron smiles wryly.  "I have given you what once would have been called a 'doozy' of a first mission, but you'll do fine.  So, go get him!"You about-face and double-time it to your ship, which has been cleared for immediate launch by Kuron himself.  Your first mission feels good, and you hope that you can live up to the trust that Kuron and House Heraan have in you.                                       bThe doors of the Great Hall of Heraan are made from ancient stone, as is the entire interior; contrasting with the steel and plastics of the rest of the Arcology.  Huge bonfires are set in recessed fire-pits in the basalt floor.  A rolling drumbeat introduces the Heraan Council as they enter the hall.Kuron steps forward from their midst, and bangs his staff on the flagstones.  Silence falls."Honored warriors!  Hear me!  The Council has heard the words of Bazara, stalwart and true warrior.  We have counselled with the Arbiter.  There is a traitor among us, to be rooted out, an honorless cur hidden among us too long, turning our affairs against us, and nearly succeeding in the capture of Bazara.  Only the courage of our Little Wolf," he declares, his palm outstretched toward you, "allowed him to return with news of this foul business."He turns to you."Little Wolf, you are amongst the youngest, it's true, but also the least well known.  Our faces and ships can be recognized too easily to allow us to join in this hunt, which is yours alone.  Find this traitor, and bring them before us.  Search our borders, listen at our posts; leave no stone in Heraani space unturned, and if you find nothing look to the Moashi dogs, as they will be involved somehow.  You leave this hall a cub," he smiles.  "May you return in glory."                                       «Techerakh now turns to you and grins."I'm not goin' to blow smoke up your bum, {G"boyo" "lass"}.  Kuron can do that.  What I am goin' to say is that the destruction of the Moashi is the most important task that I could ever take on, 'tis me life's work."  He gestures along the edges of Auroran space on a holographic map."There are rumors of a supply fleet moving from Federation space into Moashi space.  You've just got the job to destroy it.  Only problem is it has connections with the Bureau of Internal Investigations.  This 'Bureau' is supposedly a department of officials dedicated to protecting the Federation from espionage, but, in reality, they basically run the Federation.  These guys make the most bloodthirsty of killers look like my Aunt Daffodil.  They have no honor whatsoever.  If the Bureau is working with the Moashi, we know who to blame for the blockade of Dominance.  Combine that with Bariod's treachery and you have a merry mix.  But this is just conjecture.  I need you to check out the ships in that convoy.  I suggest that you disable one and board it.  Capture some of the cargo, and then destroy the rest of the convoy.  You may get lucky and find the escort light.  If not, you will have a real fight on your hands.  Get it?  Good!"You smile at Techerakh.  Even though he is the toughest warrior in the ranks of House Heraan, he also has a sense of humor.  Bidding farewell to all, you rise and decamp. î You meet a number of warriors in a briefing room at the spaceport.  All of them are hardened looking men and women, and Techerakh knows all of them by name.  You are surprised to be introduced to Karrod the Gifted.  He smiles at you, showing a mouth full of chipped and broken teeth, and the plastic of his cybernetic hand feels cool to you as you shake.  He notices your gaze, and chuckles to himself."{G"Never refuse your wife anything she asks for, and maybe she'll let YOU keep all yer limbs." "Don't you start!  My wife already took one hand, I'm not looking to lose to another women.  Imagine what she would do to me then!"}"You laugh heartily.  If Karrod can make jokes before a mission, he must be able to handle himself well.  He is after all known as 'The Gifted' because of his ability to kill large numbers of enemies.  Rumor has it that he lost his hand in battle against Techerakh to decide which of them should be Thurokiir.  You do feel better knowing that Karrod is going with you.                                       ûThe gathering in the council chamber is a much quieter one the next morning, as you gently sit down.  Nuada and Tuatha are present, but having not joined in the celebrations of the night before, look many times better than anyone else there.  Kuron clears his throat, and tells you about your next assignment."You are to fly to Rimerta in the Pimen system.  Once there you are to speak with Lo Wang, a man of infinite wisdom and patience.  He'll explain what will be required from you.  Working with the Dechtakars is not easy, but you will learn much.  So, good luck, and work hard.  There may be some strange days ahead for you."                                       ≈Hune grins, suddenly glad and slaps you on the shoulder.  "You passed the first test!  Now we need to go to this cursed planet and help these silly people out.""Cursed planet?" you ask quietly."It has a giant artificial ring around it," replies Hune diffidently, "and every time the scientists try to have a look at it, they end up disappearing without a trace, taking everyone else in the system with them." You look over at him apprehensively.  Dying in battle in the service of the Heraan or the Empire is one thing, being swallowed up by an unknown menace is another.  Hune chuckles.  "Don't worry yourself, we probably will not have to be on planet for too long."                                       áLo Wang nods, satisfied with your response.  He leads you over to an older man who has a disdainful expression on his face."You would leave me in the protection of this cur from that honorless house?" sneers Duradar.  "I say that the Dechtakars are fools!"Lo Wang, unperturbed, points out that if you should fail the Moash would have a case against the Heraan House, so who better to protect you than an ancient enemy?  With a flash of insight, you realize that Lo Wang is right, and you vow to protect this scum from any harm while he is in your care."Very well," Duradar concedes in his condescending manner.  "It might be entertaining to watch one of the barbaric Heraani working towards the good of a proper House for once."You roll your eyes at Lo Wang after Duradar sweeps past, and he has a hard time keeping a straight face behind the pompous fool...                                       With a nod, Lo Wang accepts your affirmation of your honor and walks away.  As the two of you get your stuff together for the upcoming battle, Hune tells you a little about the Wild Geese."They are a group of mercenaries with a long history of battle honors.  Every now and again they are employed by various houses to help with their battle plans, and they never renege on any deal they ever make, and they fight like demons.  Of course, they are often employed by the Federation as well, and they certainly make for worthy adversaries."I'm surprised you don't know more than I," Hune breathes quietly.  "After all, the leader of the Wild Geese, a man named Eamon Flannigan, is a decorated warrior who served with the Heraani for many years - long enough to be given the battle name 'Archindar', which translates as 'he who refuses to die'.  I understand he was given that name by a former Moash Mundokiir after he covered a Heraan withdrawal, dropping back again and again to forestall the Moash fleet's forward elements.""Well then," you reply with a savage grin, "this should be a battle to remember then!"With a laugh and a slap on the shoulder, Hune moves towards his own ship, and the two of you go to do battle with these worthy opponents.                                       í"It is important that you become feared by our enemies, but that you are also known as an honorable warrior.  The reports of you while you were with the Dechtakars were very favorable.  This will do much to improve your standing in the eyes of your brothers - and our enemies."However," Techerakh continues, "there is going to be a duel in the Grip System.  Kuron feels it will be important, and I always defer to him in matters of strategy.  The man's a genius you know...and he feels that it is important that our enemies get to know just how good you are.  Of course, it will be a fight to the death, and victory cannot be claimed until the winner shows that the other warriors are dead.  It will be a bloody and fast encounter, as each House will only send one warrior.  You have been chosen to represent House Heraan.  You have a few weeks to get to Grip in order to cover yourself in glory again.  So get cracking and good hunting.  Hopefully I'll see you soon.  By the time you get back, Kuron may well be ready to do some work and plans will be brought into action."You quickly shake Techerakh's hand and head for battle.                                       µCheers of approval erupt as a multitude of hands slap you on the back and reach to be shaken.  Kuron speaks again."The ranks of House Heraan have been scoured for the Seven best warriors to join the new group.  They are...Horgar the Grim, Skultir Whose Weapons Spell Doom, Burch'ee of the Cold Death, Savard whom Death Knows Well, Syn'tax Never Fears, Jesura Iron Will and finally Bazara the Cunning."You catch yourself thinking how nice it would be to have a much more personal knowledge of the {G"beautiful Savard" "handsome Jesura"}, but stop yourself when you realize you have been staring.  {G"Savard is a fierce female warrior" "Jesura is a determined warrior"}, not much {G"younger" "older"} than you.  In fact only Horgar looks to be older than you by very far.  New tattoos are placed upon bodies wherever they will fit: a wolf, its muzzle dripping gore from a rotted skull.  The symbolism doesn't fail to strike you, for the Skull is the symbol of House Moash."Stand my warriors and be recognized," Nuada says, and 'The Pack' stands as one and feels the approval of their fellows."KarHallarn, I charge you to lead this strike force deep into the heart of Federation space and attack the forces of Sol.  Soon there will be a Federation shipping convoy passing through that system.  I feel it is right that we warn them that 'The Pack' is fearless, and that their jaws will soon close around Moashi throats."                                       ≥You are beginning to plan what you will do when you find this Eiric when Kuron continues."The Moashi have become just a little suspicious of the increase in activity on our behalf, and apparently there is much talk of you in their bars and stations."Be careful," he cautions.  "You have become something of a marked {G"man" "woman"}.  Many young warriors will try for you just to make a name for themselves.  It is important that you remain alive.  You are important for the future of this House and your dying would put a serious crimp in our plans.  So play it smart and don't get dead.  Karlaekaar said that you had a good head for battle, so use it and don't get suckered into any traps.  Go to <RST> in the <RSY> system and meet this Eiric.  Find his political leanings. {b809 "Use any influence you may have with him." ""} Probe him, but don't look too obvious.  Report back to me when you are done."                                        ÷You blast away from the spaceport, breaking a number of outbound traffic laws as you do so, but you don't care.  You have a lot of space to cover and not too much time to do it!                                       ∫"You know how Thurokiir are chosen.  Tradition is tradition.  I offer you the office of Thurokiir.  If you desire it, do battle above the heart of our House.  The winner will be the new Arbiter to avenge the death of Techerakh the Bloody Hammer.  Those who have spirit for this fight, fly out, and may your wits be sharp.  Your ships have been modified.  You will be able to kill each other, but any who kills another can never be chosen, for this battle is about skill and honor, not death, though death may follow the victor soon enough after this day."You turn and stare at your battle brothers and sister in surprise, when Burch'ee of the Cold Death pushes you out of the way as he heads for the door."C'mon," he calls over his shoulder.  "I have waited a long time to see how good you are KarHallarn.  You'll get a run for your money...Oh, by the way, good luck!"  You chase after him and prepare for battle.                                       ·You sit and think for a long time.  By the time you emerge from Techerakh's quarters, you have changed in yourself.  You have taken the Heraani cause to your heart, to make Techerakh's wishes into facts.First you have to investigate the number of Heraani ships on the Auroran Border.  Then you can at least form a strategy.  From the Communications bunker, you send a sub-space message to Hune in Rimerta, asking if he could spend some time with you on a little jaunt.  Your next stop is the bar, where you slap awake Bazara, Syn'tax, Burch'ee and {G"Jesura" "Savard"}.  You send them to man the main spaceways into Heraani space, as a precaution.  Next you inform Kuron that your oathing ceremony will have to wait, as you have too much work to do.  He is much amused by your precociousness.You wake {G"Savard" "Jesura"}, and tell {G"her" "him"} that you both must leave, unfortunately in opposite directions.  {G"Her" "His"} face drops, but you remind {G"her" "him"} that {G"her" "his"} duty, and yours is to House Heraan.  {G"She" "He"} lifts {G"her" "his"} face stoically, and you kiss {G"her" "him"} lightly before leaving for the Communications bunker.After a few minutes of waiting Hune replies he is more than happy to share your company for some time, and that he will meet you on <RST>.  With that you head to the dock.  The roar of your engines barely covers the roar of the Heraani warriors as their new Thurokiir heads for {G"his" "her"} first duty.                                       àYou plot a course and set off quickly.  You have a feeling that time is short, and that if you aren't quick, then the Moashi will spring their trap before you have discovered the way out of it.  You also realize the gamble you are taking.  If Techerakh was wrong in his suspicions, then there will be another Thurokiirs Trial in the not-to-distant future.                                       ƒYou decide that the best plan is to arrive on Aurora and deny all accusations.  The Moashi will have discredited you with the delegates of the other Houses, so you will become the focus of their anger.  It is only by luring the Moashi into believing that you have no defense that you will be able to crush them.You are reminded of an ancient battle technique called the 'Hammer and Anvil.'  Hune's information will be as the hammer; your presence will be the anvil, luring the Moashi into a position to be struck.  It will not be easy waiting for Hune to arrive, but you know you must, for the fate of House Heraan may well hang in the balance...You set off for Aurora.                                       9With three fleets heading into Heraani Space, the only way to stop them is to have your battle group hold them off until help arrives.  It will not be an easy task, as the Moashi will outnumber them many times over.  You quickly inform them of the situation, and they swear to hold to the last.{G"Savard" "Jesura"} tells you what {G"she" "he"} feels for you, and is proud of your defense of the House.  You tell {G"her" "him"} how much {G"she" "he"} means to you and blast off after the Moashi.Your battle group will split and tackle two of the three fleets, while you will attack the Main fleet.  The Moashi Mundokiir, Merrick'Ahh who Laughs at Death was responsible for the death of Techerakh the Bloody Hammer.You spend a few minutes gathering intelligence reports and you can see that the most likely route Merrick'Ahh will take goes through Derlic, Vantra and the Heraan Astra systems.  As soon as you have confirmed the ship movement reports you log off the terminal and head towards your ship.  You will have your revenge this day!                                       The Moash will try to win back some honor, and for taking the lives of your lover and friends, they will pay the ultimate price; they will lose their position as First House.  You reach your ship and blast away.  You are going to relish this.                                       GYour first logical step is the signing of a treaty with the Polaris.  You tell the Great Council that the Polaris have the most advanced technology of the known universe, and that while the Aurorans would win a war with them, the cost would be extremely high.You outline a plan in which you will travel to Polaris space, and outline all that you have said to the Council.  The Polaris, you feel, despite their fierce reputation, are not interested in large scale loss of life.  If you explain that the Empire will soon be taking control of the Federation, and all Federation space, then they will have to come into contact with the Auroran Empire sometime.If you are able to interact in peace then there will be no further need for bloodshed.  The other Houses agree, so you head for Polaris space.                                       ãBy the time you have some idea what the rebels want, you see that they are not too different from the Aurorans.  By appealing to the sense of Common Enemy, and promising that you will do your best to form a judicial system (whatever that is) it is clear that the rebels may not be all that hard a nut to crack.It appears that they are tiring of their protracted war with the Federation, and if certain expectations were met by the Great Auroran Council, then the Rebellion would join the Empire as a seventh House.  You tell them that the proposal must be put before the Council.You have also decided that the Auroran Empire needs a system other than trial by Arms for the resolution of conflict.  The smallest of matters cannot be too small for the leaders of Houses, and a Thurokiirs' Council may be worth creating.  You will return to Aurora to lobby the council.                                       You have a sneaking suspicion that the Rebels will agree to your terms, if only because they don't want to be ground to a pulp between the Auroran Empire and the Federation.  The Polaris may not agree to share their technology, but if you can bring them to the table, then the likelihood of victory over the Federation is good.  If you can get the Polaris to agree...You decide to meet with Mu'Randa again, and you send a signal into Polaris space asking her to meet you on <RST> in the <RSY> system.                                       Your interest is aroused."I have informed him of the change of situation here, and how the Federation has been trying to set up the Wild Geese.  Once he knew of their plans he was interested in our proposals.  He wants to meet with you in New Ireland.  The Wild Geese are perfect for holding the Roughnecks at bay while the main force of Auroran warriors push forward into Federation Space."A message arrives just before you leave.  Frandall reports that the Rebel High Command has agreed to the Auroran proposals.  He advises that an attack on the head of the Bureau, a woman named Krane, would throw the entire Federation into confusion.  The easiest time to kill her is when she travels from the Bureau headquarters in New England to Sol.  Apparently in five weeks she will be dropping by.You quickly dispatch to the Polaris, "The signal to attack will be the death of the head of the Bureau."  The Polaris will then attack from their shared borders.  This, combined with an all-out attack by the rebellion, and the push from Auroran space... you start to see how the plan might work.You quickly check the chronology, and tell Kuron to mass the troops on the Federation border.  His signal to attack will come from you.  You quickly head for New Ireland.                                       Z"Good," Techerakh nods brusquely.  "Here is a picture of Bazara, study it carefully, you would not want to mistake him for someone else.  It is important that you are wary, as House Moashi dogs will try to intercept them.  They are the cause of our predicament, but not for long.  Oh no, not for much longer."                                       ëWith a nod, Lo Wang accepts your affirmation of your honor and walks away.As the two of you get your stuff together for the upcoming battle, you tell Hune a little about the Wild Geese.

Of course, they are often employed by the Federation as well, and they certainly make for worthy adversaries."I'm surprised you know as much as you do," Hune breathes quietly.  You smile sadly, and tell him of some of the woes suffered by the Wild Geese at the hands of the evil Bureau, of their struggle to regain their homeland, and of the deaths of some of your friends and fellow warriors."The Heraan house have done the honorable thing," Hune notes, his face expressing his understanding of the plight of the Wild Geese and respect for your feelings towards them.  "They have protected a beautiful people and gained a strong ally at the same time.  I expect these Wild Geese to be most troublesome to face in combat.""I can guarantee you," you reply with a sad but proud grin, "this will be a battle to remember."With a nod and a slap on the shoulder, Hune moves towards his own ship, and the two of you go to do battle with your former comrades.                                        "I thought you might," she grins smugly, and if she were not offering you such hope, you would be offended by her presumption.  "We will have to set up our base camp on New Ireland.  Initially it will just be me and the other ten members of the team plus some of the equipment we need.  But it won't be long until we will be requiring your services for more equipment.  Especially considering we will be working with a world that should naturally want to stay in a terraformed state, as opposed to trying to terraform a world whose natural state is hostile to human habitation."So," she smiles happily, "when can we leave?"You smile back, wondering if she is as naive as the other terraforming team leader.  You ask her how long it will take her and her team to load up your vessel."Around three hours or so," she replies, slightly puzzled.  "Why?"With a small smile of victory you tell her that you can be ready to leave in about three hours."Oh!" she exclaims, grinning.  "You're being clever.  We will be on board within that time."You nod, feeling a little chagrined, and head off towards your ship.                                       ŒYour interest is aroused."I have informed him of the change of situation here, and how the Federation has been trying to set up the Wild Geese.

Plus I believe there have been recent developments on New Ireland that should be pleasing to you."  Despite your wheedling, he refuses to say more.A message arrives just before you leave.  Frandall reports that the Rebel High Command has agreed to the Auroran proposals.

"You agree rapidly, more than happy to help out someone seeking a contract with Eamon.  You abbreviate your normal pre-flight routine in order to get going as quickly as you can." "After agreeing to help her you ask about these 'Wild Geese'.\"They are very highly-trained mercenaries based on <RST>,\" she tells you in a hushed tone leaning forward.  \"I can't talk about the nature of my business with them, but I can tell you that their skills and capabilities are impressive.\"Now,\" she continues brightly, \"when do we leave?\""}                                       '"If you can just get me to <RST> in the <RSY> system in one piece," she tells you freely, "and preferably without being scanned by anyone, that would be great.  I'm sure you can understand that, as I am making dealings with forces that are not particularly well-liked within the Federation, I need to be a little circumspect."Still," she continues with a smile, "it shouldn't be too difficult, especially for a talented pilot such as yourself."So," she asks cheerfully, "how long until you are ready to leave?"                                       ¿"Oh, thank you!" she exclaims happily.  "I have always dreamed of seeing something left behind by the Vell-os of old!  The mystery and wonder of their ancient civilization always fascinated me when I was young, and I suppose some of it still remains in me, even though I am no longer innocent, and even less worthy."You are a little surprised at the last reference, but you shrug it off as something to do with her work."The pay shall be the same as last time," she informs you more seriously, "and I will be needing transport from <RST> to a further destination not long after we land.  So if you wait around for a few days, I will have another mission for you."                                       "My colleague's name is Bis Andreya, and she should be waiting for us on <DST> when we arrive," Mu'Randa continues cheerfully.  "She will be directing our travels from there.  That is, of course, if you are prepared to help us further."You are starting to get more than a little curious about Mu'Randa's background.  Her name is clearly not Federation in origin, and the name Bis Andreya is even more foreign."Well," Mu'Randa informs you with a happy smile, "I am ready to go when you are."                                       Í"Our scientists will be pleased," comments Mu'Randa with a smile.  "Go to <RST> in the <RSY> system and they will explain their needs further.  I believe that they want you to help them out with their studies of the Wraith."You give Mu'Randa a puzzled look at the mention of the word 'Wraith'."They are some sort of space-based life-form," she informs you.  "For some reason they attack all Polaris ships on sight, and they are very dangerous."Just be careful," she tells you with a smile.  "If you keep your wits about you, everything should work out.  Just remember that a large number of Polarans are watching you carefully because they are not sure whether or not to trust you.  Not all of them have worked with you before like Bis Andreya and I have done, so they are a little suspicious.  Something like this would go a long way towards gaining you acceptance amongst us."Regardless," she finishes with a grin, "I wish you the best of luck out there."                                       "Excellent!" he exclaims with a smile in his first break of decorum.  He continues more seriously.  "At the furthest limit of our exploration to the North-West into Wraith space we have located a gas giant which we believe that they use as some sort of 'home base', although we have no idea why.  It is one of the busiest systems in the region, and so it is the most likely place to find a Wraith corpse."When you have picked up the sample we want," P'Jeena informs you seriously, "return here and we will ensure that you are financially recompensed for your troubles."Also," he tells you formally, "we have come to an arrangement with the Nil'kemorya so that you can purchase some of our ships which have a much longer range than your Federation technology vessel, which will be more than a little handy on this mission.  I suggest that you get one."Finally," he warns quietly, "the Wraith have a history of attacking ships without warning or provocation, so keep your wits about you." ¢"If you need to recharge your ship," he continues, "or you want to reach different parts of their space, I suggest that you attack it from the South, launching from Federation space."The other course of action," he tells you with a wink, "is to buy yourself a reactor of some sort, although I think that the Nil'kemorya are only prepared to allow you access to the fusion reactor at this stage.  You know how warriors are, always super-concerned about security and so on."To help us gather more information," P'Jeena explains , "you will be carrying our latest in scanning technology.  It will just sit in your cargo-hold and record information regarding mass and energy fluctuations in any system you are in."If you do find another gas giant somewhere in Wraith Space," he informs you seriously, "return here immediately so that we can download the information out of the holo-scanner."                                       «"Oh, thank you!" he gushes, suddenly all smiles.  "Go to the Hot'A'Tanius system and fly around to let the modified holo-scanner emit its message for a while before returning here."When you return we will read over the data the holo-scanner will be recording," P'Jeena explains, "to see if any of the Wraith replied to our message.  Hopefully, at least one will agree to meet with us and we will be able to actually talk with it!  The possibilities are enormous!  We could learn so much!"You casually point out that you could also try to find out why the Wraith keep attacking the Polaris, and perhaps sort out the problem."I didn't even think of that," says P'Jeena, taken aback.  "We will have to get the Mu'hari and the Nil'kemorya in on this, won't we?"You shake your head at the scientist's naivete, and leave him muttering to himself as he tries to figure out all the possible ramifications of the hoped-for meeting.                                       "Thank you," she tells you gratefully, "we really appreciate it.  The Wraith's name is <SN>, and from what we can gather from his limited transmissions on his way here, he is by far the oldest Wraith alive, at 206 cycles.  Now, if these cycles are based upon the orbit of the gas giant in the Hot'A'Tanius system, that would make him a little under 1100 years old.  He should be arriving in this system in an hour or so, and then he will follow you to Kel'ar Iy.  All five of the caste-leaders and the Polaris Ruling Council will meet him there."And, if possible," she adds with her usual grin, "I wouldn't mind a lift back to Kel'ar Iy myself."You nod, waving it away, telling her that it would be no problem."One last thing," she warns seriously, "not that anything should happen in Polaris space along the way, but if this Wraith should die while in our custody, our relationship with the Wraith would go downhill rapidly, so try to keep him from harm if possible."How long until we are ready to leave?"                                       “"This mission is more for show than out of any real concern for <SN>," explains Iuso quietly after coming over.  "Just escort him back to <RST> in the <RSY> system.  I very much doubt that there will be any trouble."We must make sure that news of these talks reaches everyone," he ruminates thoughtfully.  "Mu'Randa, could you see to disseminating this information as widely as possible?""Of course, Iuso," Mu'Randa replies in an oddly subservient manner, "The Mu'hari are always ready to serve.""I know," Iuso replies respectfully, "and I have always respected you all the more for it."Mu'Randa turns slightly red with embarrassment, although you could almost swear that she feels slightly ashamed by it all.  Iuso turns to you."You have done well, <PN>," he praises you seriously.  "You have managed to continually impress me with your insight and resourcefulness.  I'm going to be keeping my eye on you, young {G"man" "woman"}."                                       i"Thank you, Captain <PN>," she tells you gratefully, "we have been a little worried about this ever since our talks with the Wraith.  We really need to know if there is anything out there that might affect us in any way, so that we can prepare ourselves for it."If you could explore the far Western edges of Wraith space," Mu'Randa continues, "and perhaps even a little beyond, it would give us a large amount of information about the outside universe.  We are actually less interested in what lies within Wraith space as in what lies beyond it.  So much of space north of the Federation is unknown to us.  If you find anything that needs our attention, report back to us on Mu'ar Haro as soon as possible."Well, good luck," she finishes, with {G"a devastating smile" "an enormous grin"}.  "I hope to hear from you in a few months."                                       Ã"Oh, thank you!" she gushes with a sincere smile.  "If you had said no I would have been forced to try to get another pilot who had never been there before to help me out, and that could have turned into a VERY long trip."All we have to do," she explains simply, "is go to <RST> in the <RSY> system, and the 'Rebel' leaders should meet us there as we have already sent a message to them telling them to expect us."From there the plan gets a little more vague," she chuckles slightly.  "Since we know next to nothing about them, we will have to play it by ear a little and see what we can find out."Anyway, that's quite enough talk," she decides firmly.  "When do we leave?"                                       Mu'Randa leads you to the conference room where you chatted with the Rebel leaders yesterday.  You see the five of them and Geoff Daniels sitting in discussion when you walk in."What you have told us is very disturbing," Mu'Randa informs them without preamble.  "We will be returning to Polaris Space immediately to inform the Council of the events here, and they will no doubt begin investigating your allegations against this 'Bureau of Internal Investigation' and the Federation in general.  If, as a result of our investigation, we find that your accusations are justified, we will recontact you, and may offer you our support.""That is all that we could ever ask of you," replies Dr. Pentecost.  "Would you like a copy of our library file on the Bureau to aid you in your research?""I have already obtained a copy," Mu'Randa shrugs at their surprise.  "Our technology is more advanced than your own.""Well, in that case," Dr. Pentecost replies politely, "we thank you for taking the time to meet with us."                                       Í"If you haven't already guessed," Mu'Randa explains seriously, "we are sending out feelers into the Federation to see if we can turn up anything on this 'Bureau'.  The sooner we can get people in place, the better."Mu'Randa starts to get up to leave, but you stop her with one word."Ory'hara?" you ask quietly.Mu'Evlin grins slightly and looks away, but Mu'Randa looks at you for a moment, obviously contemplating something."If you are going to be moving in and around the Federation," she explains somehow sadly, "you will need to be known by something other than your birth-name, to protect your identity in the event that any of our people are caught.  And somehow I think the name will come to fit you better the longer you wear it."As she walks away you realize that her somewhat cryptic response brought up more questions than it answered."So, ah, when do we go?" asks Mu'Evlin, breaking your train of thought and bringing you back to the present.                                       ÕAs he shakes your hand you ask him if he can tell you anything about the name Mu'Randa gave you."There is something of a legend behind you now," he smiles quietly, rising from his seat, "and there is an even bigger legend behind the word 'Ory'hara'.  But I do not think that it is my place to inform you of it, and I doubt that any Polaris will do so for similar reasons."Do not worry," he tells you in his reserved manner, "in time the legend of Ory'hara will be revealed to you, and you will understand how much it means, and why you now wear the name you do."As he walks away you shake your head, realizing that without saying much, Mu'Evlin has raised your curiosity even further about the name you have been given.  It appears that there is some sort of story behind the name 'Ory'hara', and that it somehow can be applied to you.You shake your head again, deciding to ask about it further when you get to your destination.                                       íMessage to:  Ory'haraMessage from:  Mu'RandaMu'Evlin has managed to pass on some information that I believe requires another Mu'hari to be transported to <RST> in the <RSY> system to follow it up, and I have chosen Mu'Yana to do the job.  She is currently located on <DST> in the <DSY> system.  She will provide you with any further details you need.Good luck!                                       îMessage to:  Ory'haraMessage from:  Mu'RandaMu'Evlin has managed to pass on some information that I believe requires another Mu'hari to be transported to <RST> in the <RSY> system to follow it up, and I have chosen Mu'Dren to do the job.  He is currently located on <DST> in the <DSY> system.  Any further details will be provided when you pick him up.Good luck!                                       “Message from:  Mu'Randa<cont>In the past I have occasionally gone into the Federation myself to scout for various things, and whenever I found myself drawing a blank, I would always go and see one man who somehow would, without fail, push me in the right direction.  His name is Eamon Flannigan, {b818 "you should remember him from your time with the Wild Geese" "and he is the leader of the 'Wild Geese', a mercenary outfit based on <RST> in the <RSY> system"}.  Very few people are as well travelled ({b818 "As you may already know he" "He"} is called 'Archindar' by the Aurorans and is acknowledged by them as a warrior and master of the Heron style of martial arts), or as knowledgeable about the political state of the Federation.I want you to find him and ask him if he can help us out with any information regarding the Bureau.  Chances are he won't tell us anything straight out, but he might suggest a way for us to find out what we want to know.  {b818 "I'm sure that I don't need to tell you to treat" "Treat"} him with utmost respect as {b818 "you would know that he" "he"} is one of the most skilled warriors around.  Even the Nil'kemorya speak of his deeds with open admiration.                                       "But, tell me, why are you here?" he goes on to ask.  "What does Mu'Randa want now?"You quickly outline the reasons behind the Polaris investigation of the Bureau.  After giving him some of the details of the operation you finish by telling him of Mu'Randa's comments, and asking him if he can be of any help.When you finish Eamon leans back, and looks down at the table.  "She certainly can pick them," he mutters quietly, shaking his head smiling.  "I take it the Mu'hari have been concentrating on the major centers of Federation space?"  You nod, to which he shakes his head before continuing, "The Bureau doesn't operate out in the open, they'll never find out much doing that.  When you get back to Mu'Randa tell her to put somebody on New England.  From there they should be able to get onto the right track."In the meantime," he tells you, rising, "I suggest that you keep practicing your new skills, and I would look at training with the Nil'kemorya as they could definitely teach you a thing or two."                                       ÙMessage to:  Ory'haraMessage from:  Mu'RandaI have been in contact with Mu'Evlin and he has managed to uncover some disturbing information about the Bureau that backs up Eamon's suggestion to place an agent on <RST> in the <RSY> system.  Mu'Feren will be waiting for you to pick her up on <DST> in the <DSY> system.  If anything comes up between now and then she will be provided with the details so that she can pass it on to you when you see her.Good luck!                                       "I knew I could count on you," smiles Mu'Randa happily, "you are always prepared to help out."Getting back to the point," she grins, "tell the Rebels that we are prepared to allow them to send a single diplomat to stay on Kel'ar Iy along with whatever staff he or she needs.  All the normal diplomatic rules apply; diplomatic immunity and the like."While you are there," she laughs quietly, "you can tell them to stop trying to hide their copies of our Dragon.  We don't mind that they have started producing them, as they are probably the least combat capable of all our craft, and we have no problems with helping out our new friends by allowing them access to the original schematics.  We are, however, very interested in finding out how they managed to get the plans in the first place."Another thing," Mu'Randa continues more seriously.  "Avoid all Federation vessels as much as possible.  Now that we know more about the Bureau, we know that they have access to the sensor logs of all Federation vessels."                                       Without batting an eyelid, you answer that the Polaris are prepared to begin whenever the Rebels are ready."Then can you pass a message on to them that we will need a few guides," he replies quietly, "to show us the way to and from the Polaris capital."You smile and ask if it would be possible for the lead elements of the embassy be loaded aboard your ship, and that a Rebel ship follow you from here to <RST> in the <RSY> system."Good idea," agrees General Smart, before turning to Dr. Pentecost.  "How long until you can be ready to leave with what you need to start putting together the embassy?""A few hours," Dr. Pentecost replies, "no more."You stand up and say that you will be waiting on board your ship to help with the loading of his equipment.  With a nod to the two Rebel leaders and a quick look around the rest of the patrons you head out of the bar, aware from the weaves emanating from everyone in the room that they are all very happy with the outcome of the impromptu meeting.                                       ¯"Nobody knows more about all aspects of martial arts, and the spirituality behind them, than the Nil'kemorya," Mu'Randa explains.  "Your talents are so great that nobody else could hope to keep up with you.  The head of the warrior's physical combat school has asked if he could have the honor of training you.  His name is Arando, and if ever anyone could train you to your maximum potential, it would be him.  The warriors have a tradition of physical challenges, and in seventy years, nobody has ever bested him in any form of physical combat."He lives in a mountain range on the warrior-caste homeworld," she continues, "where he trains his students, who are those who have been chosen to be the next generation of masters on the three warrior-caste training worlds.  He will be waiting for your arrival."Your time with him will be hard," Mu'Randa breathes quietly, and you sense her thoughts are far away from the present, "but you will not learn more from anyone else."                                       W"Once again you have lived up to your name, Ory'hara," he comments shrewdly, "proving your worth to the Polaris people."Our long-range sensor readings show that this fleet will reach the Nil'ikro system soon," he informs you solemnly.  "And while in many ways we admire the Auroran warrior ethic, we know that they respect strength above all else.  If we do not drive them off decisively, it would only make them try harder."So make sure that none of their ships escape from the field of battle," he concludes plainly, "and when you're finished return here."                                       ´"You are a true warrior, Ory'hara," he tells you with quiet admiration, "you have shown that your life is worth less than the safety of the Polaris people."We believe that this fleet will reach the Nil'kemorya system within the next several days," he informs you solemnly.  "We can but admire the Auroran warriors in their efforts to prove themselves as worthy adversaries, but we cannot allow them to cross our borders.  If we do not drive them off decisively, it would only make them try harder."So once again make sure that none of their ships escape from the field of battle," he concludes plainly, "and when you're finished return here."                                       X"I knew I could count on you," she gushes, happy again.  She waves over a black-garbed Mu'hari and a gray-cloaked warrior whom you instantly recognize.  "Allow me to introduce Mu'Sentan, and I believe you and Drengar were both students under Arando."You nod respectfully to Mu'Sentan and greet Drengar with a warm smile and a strong warrior's handshake."As you all know," Mu'Randa continues quietly, "the Aurorans have been very active of late, and we are getting a little suspicious of what is going on.  I went and had a chat with my old friend Eamon Flannigan, and he told me that similar incidents have been happening along the Federation border as well.  He also suggested that we make contact with the Dechtakars, whom he also called the Rimertans, and the Heraan House."Now, we have no idea where to go to make contact with either of these groups," she explains carefully, "so it is up to you to find them and then open talks with them.  I suggest that you start by heading South, perhaps to <RST> in the <RSY> system, and ask for further directions from there."                                       z"I wanted to meet the {G"man" "woman"} who did my battle-brothers the honor of showing them {G"his" "her"} full strength," announces the larger of the two heavily-muscled warriors.  "I am Drekhma, and I greet you in peace.""I am Hakhic," begins the other warrior, "and I too wanted to show my respect."They both nod their heads in a respectful motion before taking their leave and walking away."You seem to have made something of an impression," Drengar comments wryly.  "It's a good thing we're trying to keep this low-key, otherwise we might have had to go around begging to get some attention."You chuckle at his humor before downing the rest of your drink and getting up.  Taking their cue from you, both of the Polaris also stand and the three of you make your way back to your beloved <PSN> to begin another long journey across the galaxy.                                       "Now, getting back to the business at hand," Mu'Sentan continues, "Du'Nakh was unwilling to talk about what all the Auroran activity was about, but I could tell that he was more than a little suspicious about it, and not completely happy with it.  He was however more than happy to give me the co-ordinates for the Heraan system."He intimated that the Heraan House might well be the best people to ask regarding the recent actions by the Aurorans," he explains in a low voice, leaning forward.  "Apparently they are sworn enemies of the Moash House who are the First Family.  Which means that while they have pledged support to the First Family, and they fight alongside First Family warriors every day against the enemies of the Empire, they actively fight against those same warriors trying to undermine the position of the Moash House."If anyone would be willing to talk with us about what is going on," Mu'Sentan concludes quietly, "the Heraan House would be it."                                       ‹Drengar nods impassively, but you can sense the excitement beneath his calm exterior."I would be honored to stay here with you," he replies softly.They both turn to you, and, after an awkward moment, you realize that they are trying to say goodbye.  You shake your head and smile at their reverence, remembering when you were just a struggling freighter captain working out of Port Kane.You stand and wordlessly shake the hands of both Polarans before heading back to the docking bay to prepare your beloved <PSN> for another long journey, this time back to Mu'ar Haro in Polaris space.  As you walk along you cannot help but feel the sense of awe emanating from the people you see.  You are more than a little grateful when you finally make it back to your ship.  Heading out into space you breath a sigh of relief, glad to be away from such worship.You point your ship in the direction of Mu'ar Haro, and begin your long lonely journey back.                                       °"I thought you might want to come along," she continues with one of her trademark smiles.  "The other reason why I'm glad you came along is that I need a lift to see it myself.  They are conducting the experiments on the <RST> station in the <RSY> system, so that's where we need to get to."I have been assured by a number of different Ver'ash and P'aedt involved with the project," Mu'Randa continues brightly, "that they feel as if they are on the verge of a major breakthrough soon, so you might want to hurry."You grin at her not so subtle hint and you invite her to lead the way back to your beloved <PSN> to begin the journey.                                       "I knew I could count on you," Mu'Randa smiles at you in thanks before getting down to business.  "We have already told the Rebels to prepare for the Federation's sudden weakness, and we believe that they are planning a strike against the Bureau's headquarters on New England, but first we must remove the enslaving device from at least one Vell-os.  Once we've done that, the freed Vell-os will be able to take the strain for at least one other, and in no time the entire race will be freed."But it won't be easy," Mu'Randa warns.  "You see the Vell-os have been ordered to stop anyone from removing the devices, so you can expect them to fight you with everything they have."Simply put," she summarizes quietly whilst handing you a small hypodermic syringe, "we want you to go and bring back Llyrell from his current home on <DST> in the <DSY> system and take him to <RST> in the <RSY> system.  The sedative in that syringe should be strong enough to keep even a Vell-os unconscious for several weeks."                                       g"Thank you, Ory'hara," she breathes sincerely, "this is something of an emergency.  You see, since Dr. Pentecost was elected the new Federation President, he has generously been sharing intelligence with us.  Basically we have learned that just before they were discredited the Bureau had managed to forge an alliance with the Moash House, and we have reason to believe that they have fled to Moash Space with a sizeable fleet of Federation vessels in an effort to regain a toehold on the universe."It is urgent that you pass all this on to the Heraan House," she explains quietly, "as we think that they may be in imminent danger of being attacked by a combined fleet of Moash and Bureau forces.  Once you've done that you're going to have to decide on your own what action to take from there, as we don't know enough to help you."                                        "All you have to do," he explains quietly, "is go to <RST> in the <RSY> system and explain to them that the Elders of the Heraan House wish for one of them to witness events of interest to the Ruling Council.  They will send at least one Dechtakar with you, and then you will take him or her to the Moash system to witness whatever is there.  Once you have done that return here to pick me up and we will journey to Aurora to confront the First Family over their actions."Ory'hara, you have the thanks of the Heraan House," Techerakh states formally as he stands up to leave, "your name will not soon be forgotten.  I will leave you now to spend time with your Battle-Brothers."You spend the rest of the afternoon chatting and laughing with both the young Polarans, whom have become far more animated for their contact with the Auroran culture.  Even the reverence they feel for you as 'Ory'hara' has been muted down to mere respect, and for the first time in many months you enjoy yourself.                                       Õ"You may think that he has only had a peripheral role in all the recent goings on in the galaxy," Techerakh warns Du'Nakh, "but he has not.  More than that, anybody with the skill necessary to intuitively observe the weaves of life, has felt the disturbances he has made to the fabric of the universe on the odd occasions when he has unleashed his power, and it is frightening.  His abilities approach the limitless.""Is that true?" asks Du'Nakh.  "Could you, say, ah... I don't know, destroy a world, for instance?"You sit thinking for a moment, and you realize that if you really wanted to, you probably could.  You shrug and nod noncommittally."By the Gods!" Du'Nakh swears.  "Well I am glad we have you on our side!"You smile wanly, wishing that Techerakh hadn't been so forthcoming about your abilities.  You stand, suggesting that it is time to get moving.  Both Du'Nakh and Techerakh sense your mood and nod in agreement.                                       "In a fortnight the Thurokiirs' council will meet," he continues grimly, "and they will decide on who will become the new First Family, and although I don't want to preempt their decision, I will be surprised if the Heraan House doesn't assume that responsibility."In the meantime," he says quietly, "I have spoken with the representatives of all the houses, except obviously the Moash House, and they have all agreed in principle to opening diplomatic relations with the Polaris.  Of course, this still has to be agreed to by the Polaris and it has to be ratified by the full Council when it next meets, but I would like you to pass on the offer."And one last thing," he says, looking you straight in the eye.  "There will be a great many songs written and sung about the events of this day.  I swear to you on my honor that I will make sure that your name is mentioned first in all of them, Ory'hara."As he walks away you realize that his last statement was no idle honor, and that he meant every word.                                       When you calmly nod, you cannot help but sense the surge of pride from everyone nearby as they try to observe the goings on."Thank you, Ory'hara," responds Llyrell.  "Of all the people in this room, I am the only one besides yourself who has felt the Krypt-mind, and so I know the danger you are placing yourself in for us, but without you we would be lost."He looks over at P'Jeena, and you sense the young scientist's discomfort rise sharply."Our analysis from your last trip was again incomplete," he mutters uncomfortably, "but we were able to pick up some residual psychic phenomena embedded into parts of Vell-os, and Llyrell was able to identify the patterns as being similar to those of some of the members of the Krypt-tokh just before the end of the Vell-os War."So we want you to go to Vell-os with Llyrell," he explains, shifting in his seat, "and then take it from there.""...and when you are finished," Mu'Randa pipes up sadly, "I will be waiting for you on Mu'ar Haro."                                       LWithout a word you indicate with a subtle weave that she should follow, and you lead her back to your beloved <PSN>.  She watches, her eyes widening in wonder, as you go through the preflight checklist without moving a muscle.After takeoff you turn to Mu'Randa and ask if there is anything else that the Polaris will need of you."I believe that there will be one more thing," she answers reluctantly, the wonder in her eyes being replaced by shame.  "We have placed ourselves in an untenable position, and only you can extricate us from it."But it was not my doing," she tells you quietly, "and I will leave the telling of it to those who were responsible."With a single nod you turn back to your internal struggle against the call of the universe.  You know that soon enough, all this will be over.                                        –As you centre yourself in the universe, almost absent-mindedly you set a course for Port Kane in the Kania system to begin the destruction of the Federation war-machine...                                       Ó"Our offer is very simple," states Tre'Nerida politely, "we are prepared to allow United Shipping Ships to trade with us with the single restriction that they are only allowed to land on the planet Tre'ar Zalom in the Tri'niphu system.  Of course, if the Nil'kemorya catch any non-Polaris ships in any other systems other than those systems between Tri'niphu and the Federation, they will be destroyed."At our end," he finishes respectfully, "we will forward all the goods we wish to trade with the Federation to Tre'ar Zalom."That is our offer," he states quietly, "and if you could take it to United Shipping's head office on the Kane Band and return here with their response, it would be much appreciated."                                       x"Excellent!" he exclaims with a smile in his first break of decorum.  He continues more seriously.  "At the furthest limit of our exploration to the North-West into Wraith space we have located a gas giant which we believe that they use as some sort of 'home base', although we have no idea why.  It is one of the busiest systems in the region, and will allow us to garner highly accurate data by allowing us to observe numerous Wraith."You will have to give the equipment we will load on board your ship a few minutes to take all the necessary readings," P'Jeena informs you seriously, "after which you can return here and we will ensure that you are financially recompensed for your troubles."Also," he tells you formally, "we have come to an arrangement with the Nil'kemorya so that you can purchase some of our ships which have a much longer range than your Federation technology vessel, which will be more than a little handy on this mission.  I suggest that you get one."Finally," he warns quietly, "the Wraith have a history of attacking ships without provocation, so keep your wits about you." æ"Thank you," he accepts gratefully.  "This may well prove to be one of the biggest advances in technology in decades in terms of how it could affect the political landscape of all Known Space.  If this information falls into the wrong hands somehow, and these people have the scientific know-how to understand the information I now have, it could mean serious changes to the balance of power throughout the galaxy."Still," he shrugs, "it cannot hurt if we develop the technology and use it to defend our borders against incursions by outside influences, and to do that I need to get to <RST> in the <RSY> system.  All the brightest scientists and engineers dream of being asked to serve there.  Nearly all the greatest advances in ship design and technology over the last few centuries have come out of there."Hopefully," he concludes in his bookish manner, "this will prove to be another successful experimentation."                                       T"Thank you," murmurs P'Jeena gratefully at your acceptance of the mission.  "I'll let Ver'Lliana explain the nature of the experiment.""We have built a ship designed specifically for being under cloak," she informs you after you turn your head slightly to face her.  "We have named it the Zephyr, and as we speak it is currently undergoing space testing of its flight systems."When you are ready," she continues pleasantly, "if you could take off from the station and try to observe it as it flies around the system cloaking and un-cloaking.  When you have observed it for a while, return to the station."We will be loading the very same holo-scanning technology on board your ship," she finishes quietly, "that you were carrying during your voyage into Wraith space."Anyway, we will be ready when you are."                                       ä"Thank you," exclaims Ver'Lliana with grateful exuberance.  "We have removed the old cloaking organ from a Zephyr and grown a new one with the new capabilities."When you are ready," she continues pleasantly, "if you could take off from the station and try to observe it as it flies around the system cloaking and un-cloaking.  When you have observed it for a while, return to the station.""As with the last experiment," P'Jeena adds with bookish exactitude, "we will be loading the very same holo-scanning technology on board your ship as you were carrying last time."Anyway, we will be ready when you are."                                       ™"Thank you," exclaims Ver'Lliana with grateful exuberance.  "We have grown a few Tunnelling Organs and have seeded them in different ships to observe their effectiveness.  We have kept one here for you."When you are ready," she continues pleasantly, "go and grab it from the outfitting area.""Once you have it," P'Jeena adds with bookish exactitude, "if you could go from here, head over to the Kania system, making sure you land on Port Kane (so that we can get a grounded reading), and then return, it should give us enough readings to be able to safely adjust the organ to differing ship types."I guess we will see you when you return."                                       "Thank you, Ory'hara," P'Jeena tells you sincerely after you agree to help out.  "You probably don't know this, but most P'aedt are grateful to you for starting the recent boom in advancements due to the opening up of the border with the Wraith, led by your efforts, and your recent contact with the Aurorans."What we want you to do," he explains, getting down to business, "is to locate the 'homeworld' of the Vell-os, which goes by the same name.  We know it is located somewhere to the north-west of what is now Federation space, but our ancient records are a little sketchy so unfortunately we can't be any more specific."We hope that if this Krypt is as curious as the Vell-os claim it is," he tells you quietly, "that it will somehow try to make contact with you.  Of course, we know that this might be dangerous, but of anyone alive, you are perhaps the most capable of dealing with any danger it might present."When you have finished," he finishes a little tiredly, "return here with your findings."                                       After a short walk he leads you into his private apartment and you both sit down."We are aware of the Krypt-mind that overwhelms much of the galactic north-west," he begins quietly.  "Unfortunately, it is a mind of enormous intelligence and curiosity, but little moral compunction.  Every Vell-os who has attempted to make contact with it has been attacked and overwhelmed by the nanite-pods that are its physical form.  To this day we do not know why."You tell Llyrell that the P'aedt were wondering if the Krypt had something to do with some Vell-os the Polaris dealt with centuries ago."They mean the 'Krypt-tokh'," he mutters, nodding thoughtfully.  "It is possible.  They were the focus of our entire race, in a way you could say that they were our leaders.  They disappeared from our memory just before the end of the war.  What happened to them, we do not know."Anyway, I hope that helps," he tells you quietly.  "Perhaps it will lead you to further understanding.  I wish you well, Ory'hara."                                       œ"We noticed an odd-looking ship that appeared in the Koria system," P'Jeena explains in his quiet voice.  "You may remember it as being identified as a 'Krypt Pod'."Anyway, we've been trying to identify it ever since we learned about it," he continues thoughtfully.  "Unfortunately the only reference to Krypt we have found comes from some of our most ancient archives referring to a group of Vell-os that we dealt with when they rescued us from the Colonial Council nearly seven centuries ago."So we want you to go and see the Vell-os who is posted to the Kane University on Earth," P'Jeena concludes slowly, "I believe his name is Llyrell, and ask him if he can help us with our enquiries.  Once you have done that, meet me on P'ar Aed and we will talk further."You tell him that you would be glad to help him try to uncover the mystery, shake his hand and head back to your ship to begin preparing her for the long trip to Earth.                                       {"Thank you," he responds sincerely after you give a nod of acquiescence.  "You see, it has been nearly seven centuries since anyone has set foot on our homeworld, and I was wondering if you could find it for me?  We Vell-os can remember its exact location, but not the route to or from it."It would mean a great deal to all of us if you could bring us news about its final fate," he tells you quietly.  "I cannot join you as I have business here, but I will be waiting for your return with great anticipation."With that he turns around and walks away leaving you wondering at the odd encounter.                                       "Is this {G "him" "her"}?" asks the woman of Fllyraen, who nods sadly.  "Grab {G "him" "her"}."The four men jump on you, overpowering you in an instant, and you are led into the depths of a secure area of the spaceport while everybody around pointedly looks the other way.  Within minutes you are anaesthetized and put under the knife.  When you wake up you can feel a cold metallic lump attached to the back of your neck, and you know without moving that something has been attached to your central nervous system."Just so you know, you now work for us," comes the commanding voice of the female leader of the team who captured you.  "The device attached to the back of your neck was devised during the Vell-os War to enslave telepaths, and one has been attached to every Vell-os since then."Now that you have been pacified," she continues dismissively, "I am ordering you back to Earth to be trained by Llyrell.  Secondly, don't cut your hair ever again.  Finally, you are not to buy any outfits or ships that are not Federation technology, and even then, only those that would not require a license.  At this stage we don't want you to stand out in any way, so you will have to make do with that.  You can buy the licenses if you want, but they will be worthless to you.  While I have you here, we will be temporarily disabling your access key to the public Mission BBS, at least until you are more obviously a Vell-os."You find yourself nodding helplessly and complying with her wishes without thought.                                       "What I'm ordering you to do," Krane continues, "is to infiltrate the organization that calls themselves 'the Rebellion'.  We'll spread the rumor that you are on the run from us after narrowly escaping capture at the hands of a counter-terrorism team.  That should be enough to get you started."If, during your travels," she shifts again, "you see a ship called the 'Prodigal Son', it'll be because we want to contact you.  Finish your current mission then come to the bar here and we'll go through the normal procedure.  Perhaps it would be best if you continually checked the Earth bar, in case you miss the 'Prodigal Son', or if we can't put it in your path."Go now to Rebel II in the Koria system," she orders with quiet authority, "and tell the rebels you want to aid them somehow, as the Bureau is not what you thought it was.  They will take it from there."Be careful, <PN>," she warns sincerely.  "I only just recently gained your services, I don't want you dying on me just yet."                                       q"All right then," he says squaring his shoulders, "if you could go to <DST> in the <DSY> system and pick up <CQ> tons of <CT> and bring it back here, it would be much appreciated.  Ask for Jay when you return, and I'll make sure it gets distributed to the right people."When you're on <DST>," Jay continues, "make sure you get your produce from a guy named Burton.  He's willing to sell his food to people he hasn't seen before so he's your man."You thank him sincerely but he merely eyes you askance, and after observing his mind for a moment you sense that he doesn't like having his off-duty hours interrupted."Next time," he warns picking up his drink, "don't bring everyday business to the bar.  I like my time off."You nod your head and start heading back to your beloved <PSN> leaving Jay to savor the rest of his drink in peace.                                       Ó"In reality this mission is fairly simple," Jay continues quietly, "not too different from the cargo missions you have been doing, except that you will be picking up a passenger rather than freight."The young lady in question, whose name is Anna, lives on <DST> in the <DSY> system," he tells you seriously.  "Make sure you aren't spotted on the way out as the Bureau would really like it if they stumbled onto a Rebel extraction."Jay leans forward to emphasize his next point, and you can sense the urgency behind his words, "The Rebellion prides itself on looking after its people when it can.  Our leaders have made a vow to extract any agent in trouble if it is possible without further compromising security.  It is one of the things that allows the Rebellion to employ so many people, otherwise many would simply not pluck up the courage to join, and we would be struggling even more than we are.""Good luck, Captain <PN>," he tells you.  "You may need it."                                       Œ"We're talking now about insertion missions," Jay continues quietly, "where you take an agent from here and plant them wherever they need to go to start their new lives as informants."Allow me to introduce Fiona," he indicates the woman next to him.  "She needs to get to Dunroamin in the Journey's End system.  The usual deal applies in keeping away from the Federation and the Bureau.  Good luck to the both of you."You nod without thinking, knowing that this brave young lady is about to gain first-hand knowledge of the depravities of the Bureau.  Despite your wishes to the contrary, you find yourself setting a course to <RST> in accordance with Commander Krane's wishes.                                       :"Okay," she nods, continuing in a business-like tone."Obviously," she tells you with a casual wave, "I can't reveal to you any details of the coming operation for reasons of operational security, so you'll be going into this a little blind.  However, I'm sure that with your telepathic abilities you will manage to get by."You nod and indicate that she should continue."I want you to head down to <DST> in the <DSY> system," she informs you after referring to a report on her desk.  "Land somewhere and have a quick look around, find out what you can about their current status politically, economically and militarily.  When you've given the place the once over, head back here and report to me."Any questions?" she asks.  "No?  Good.  I look forward to hearing your report soon."                                       c"It's fairly simple really," she explains with a casual wave, "all you have to do is head down to the station '<DST>' in the <DSY> system and take a task-force with you.  While you're there cause as much damage as possible.  The ships going with you will be carrying a sizeable force of ground troops who will cause as much havoc as possible once you are onboard the station."When the land commander, General Sutton, is satisfied that he has completed his mission," she continues cheerfully, "return here and we'll take things from there.  If things go as planned, I might need you to head back down there again almost immediately."As she walks away you can sense that the complexity of her overall plan belies the simplicity of what she has told you.  Without a doubt there is more going on here than initially meets the eye.                                       "The elders are under house arrest on <RST> in the <RSY> system," she explains seriously.  "You are to go down there and tell them that we are prepared make them an offer."And our offer is this," Krane ticks off a finger; "firstly, we are prepared to let them return to their former pre-eminence.  Secondly, we are prepared to help them eliminate the four other houses, leaving them in complete control of Auroran Space."However, there is a catch," she continues with a sneaky grin.  "In return we ask that they become a vassal nation, not to the Federation, which they would never tolerate, but to the Bureau.  Tell them that we are willing to negotiate around the edges of these points, but if they aren't prepared to come to the table, then we are prepared to destroy them utterly and to reveal their severely weakened state to all of their rivals, who will pick over them when we are finished."Any questions?" she asks quietly.  "No?  Good.  When you are finished, return here for further orders."                                       ˜"The message details how we want them to organize several Auroran military expeditions into Federation space," she informs you quietly.  "At first this will be to supposedly 'gauge our strength', but following missions will supposedly be diversions to a main attack elsewhere."In reality," she explains quietly, "these raids will be made up of warriors not of the Moash House, and we will be informed ahead of time of their arrival and will be able to move entire fleets to meet them.  The end result will be four severely weakened houses which will be advantageous to both the Moash House and ourselves."The only reason I am telling you this," she warns meaningfully, "is because the Moash elders might not open the message pod correctly.  And if they don't its contents will be vaporized."Once you've delivered the message," she tells you standing up, obviously preparing to leave, "return to <RST> and I will make sure that further instructions are left for you there."                                       "This message inside the pod contains details on the next stage of our operation," she explains quietly.  "We want the Moash House to step up the raids into our space and begin amassing an armada of their own.  At a pre-ordained time detailed in the message you will be carrying, a Federation force will be attacked by the Moash and destroyed.  Public opinion will be inflamed and war will be declared.  An enormous Federation fleet will head down into Auroran space in response and will begin running amok, but only selectively so.  The end result will be the destruction of the other four major houses.  Then the remaining survivor, being the Moash House, will sue for peace, and we will grant it."Again, I am only telling you this," she reminds you seriously, "in case the Moash elders do not open the message pod correctly."Return to <RST> when you're done," she tells you dismissively.  You look over at the would-be suitor.  "Don't worry about him," she continues quietly.  "He will be taken care of."                                       You shake your head as you finally dissolve the protective barriers around you and make your way over to where Llyrell is standing, but you realize that you have picked up everything he has taught you in a matter of moments, and that the new weaves he has just shown you were not that difficult to follow nor was the energy required difficult for you to create.<you may yet prove to be the one that will lead us to our freedom do not worry you are not far from your own freedom but our freedom will require more effort on your part>He stands and nods his head in recognition of your prowess before moving off into the crowds milling in the spacedock.<commander krane is waiting for you in the kane band bar as we speak i suggest you meet with her>                                       :"Alright," she continues quietly.  "What we know about the Polaris isn't much, so you'll be going into this without much forewarning.  However if anyone is capable of making their way through the Polaris defense grid, it would be one of you Vell-os."Besides which," she points out seriously, "the Polaris feel that they owe you people a debt for what you did when you sided with them against the Colonial Council centuries ago."You refrain from pointing out that you are just a telepath, not a Vell-os, because the information you are getting could well save your life, and mentioning it to her might well endanger it."We have no idea where the Mu'hari have their headquarters located," she concludes dismissively.  "But once you have found it, you are to return here for a debrief."                                       gTO:  <PN>FROM:  Commander Krane     -attached pictures-INFO:  The above person, located on <DST> in the <DSY> system is suspected to be a Mu'hari spy.ORDERS:  Go to <DST> in the <DSY> system to confirm whether or not the above person is a Mu'hari spy before going to Bureau HQ on <RST> in the <RSY> system to report.                                       <PN> FROM:  Commander Krane     -attached pictures-INFO:  The above person, located on <RST> in the <RSY> system is suspected to be a Mu'hari spy.

You spend several seconds recreating his weaves whilst getting commentary from Fllyraen until you are both satisfied.  He ends the connection as quickly as he started it and you come away grinning, but a little puzzled as to why he taught you differently than Llyrell.<llyrell is a t1 even though im a strong t2 his abilities far outstrip mine not to mention that as a t1 he can unify the energy of several telepaths at once into one wave of energy to use at his disposal anyway speaking of llyrell he has been talking to krane and she wants you to meet her on new england i hope that i have cheered you up at least a little you are going to need it if you have to deal with her> "Now, as you may or may not know," Krane explains with a smile, "the Auroran operation went forward without a hitch some months ago, and we now have a unified ally that shares a border with the Polaris."So I am ordering you to liaise with an Auroran task force," she continues forcefully, "that is currently forming in the <RSY> system.  Once you have met the task force commander on the <RST> station you are to proceed to the Polaris capital Kel'ar Iy in the Kel'ariy system doing as much damage along the way as possible.  You are to act primarily as a guide but do not flinch from helping the Aurorans do their work."However," Krane cautions quietly, "the Auroran ships are largely irrelevant.  If they do not survive to return to Auroran space I won't be shedding any tears.  As it is it is going to be vexing enough to have to barter with the Moash to gain control over the Polaris."Any questions?" she asks, and you shake your head, despairing at the damage you are about to inflict.  "No?  Good."                                       ¿As you watch Ar'Krakh being led away you realize that his last statement would have shocked most Aurorans.  Despite all your telepathic abilities, only now do you sense how powerful his sense of honor is.With a sigh you close your eyes and launch your mind out into space trying to locate your friend Llyrell.  It takes you several minutes, but eventually you are able to sense his mind on Earth at the very edge of your perception.  With all your might you reach out and manipulate his mind letting him know that you will be coming to see him.  After a moment of surprise he quickly rearranges his surface thoughts to let you know that he has understood, and that he will meet you in the bar.When you open your eyes again you see standing before you a brown-cloaked woman whom you sense is the leader of the Polaris people."What will you do now?" she asks."I go to learn how to free my friends," you reply quietly.                                       øYou thank Llyrell, telling him that it will not be long until you return.  He smiles for a moment before turning serious."You had best leave quickly," he tells you, still shielding his mind.  "As soon as you leave I will be reporting you as an unenslaved telepath, and I doubt that they will be sparing any expense in trying to destroy you now that you are too powerful for them to control."You nod and the two of you clasp arms again and you begin your weaves to bring into existence your javelin shell.<good luck i hope to see you soon>With that endorsement ringing in your mind you head out into space to head back to Vell-os to find and speak with Krypt.                                       z"Excellent!" she exclaims, smiling widely.  "Well, as it happens we need someone to head over to <DST> in the <DSY> system to pick up <CQ> tons of <CT> for a client on <RST> in the <RSY> system.  This particular mission has no real deadline, which is slightly unusual, as most of our clients want their merchandise delivered by a set time."Anyway," Samantha grins happily, "another United Shipping representative will meet you at the other end and will brief you further on what to do next.  I'm sure I'll see you around in the future, <PN>."With that she gets up, shakes your hand and leaves.                                       ‚"Your reputation precedes you," she continues after you nod in agreement, "I never doubted you."One of our Federation clients," she tells you in an official tone, "is desirous of having <CQ> tons of <CT> delivered to <RST> in the <RSY> system by <DL>."Of course," Samantha explains mildly, "now that the Polaris have set everything up at their end, you can expect to find deliveries from here to the Federation quite regularly, and I'm sure that the everyone concerned would be honored to have their cargo carried by yourself."It was good to see you again Ory'hara," she says finally, " and although I would much rather stay and catch up with you I still have a thousand details to attend to..."                                       d"Excellent!" she exclaims happily.  "It's good to see that we can rely on you."Anyway," she continues in a more moderate tone but still smiling, "it's going to be my job to act as a negotiator, but I need to get to <RST> in the <RSY> system.  The pay is 50000 credits."So," she asks with a grin, "when do we leave?"                                       8"Oh, thank you!" she exclaims with relief.  "The first part of the trial was simply accepting.  If you had've refused, then that would have been it."Anyway," she tells you quietly, "they want you to head over to <DST> in the <DSY> system to pick up <CQ> ton of <CT> and deliver it to <RST> in the <RSY> system by <DL>."Another thing," she warns quietly, "you can expect the Aurorans to send a few ships out after you just to see if you're good enough to survive so watch yourself out there.  When you're finished, return here."                                        "This should be relatively easy," Samantha tells you, "especially compared to your last mission.  I just need to get back to <RST> in the <RSY> system to make my final report to the head office.  Payment will be another 50000 credits."I have no desire to stay any longer," she tells you quietly.  "Living in a warrior culture is too much for me.  If you're ready, I would like to leave now."You smile and tell her to come with you and together you head back to your ship.                                       †"I knew we could count on you," he smiles warmly before getting down to business.  "Now, here's the situation; with our recent expansion into the Auroran Empire we have begun to realize that there is a lucrative and virtually untapped market in trading certain small 'valuable' goods between discerning members of the Federation and the Empire."Of course the trip will be a lot longer," he continues quietly, "and the commensurate risk is higher, but the pay is good.  We already have a few trial orders in and one of them is for a delivery of 'Made-by-Helen'(tm) clothing to a gentleman on <RST> in the <RSY> system by <DL>."The pay will be 100000 credits upon completion," Sean informs you with a smile.  You have to go to <DST> in the <DSY> system to pick up the merchandise before heading down to the Empire.  You will be met upon arrival by a United Shipping official."Good luck."                                       ±<now you will not need a pile of metal any longer nor will you need any of those computer systems these humans need to see the space around them you can fly as free as your mind can visualize><go now to see fllyraen he will share with you our history and our dreams listen for you may be the one who lead us out of slavery you have it in you>With that Llyrell turns and walks away, and you are left trying to take in the enormous number of things he has shown you.  Your mind almost feels tipsy with the overload.  You walk away, unsure whether you feel ready to give away your faithful vessel and begin living your life as a purely mental being...                                       –As you walk away shaken, you realize that Llyrell was only responding according to his orders, and that if he had wanted to hurt you there would have been precious little you could have done about it.  He just wants you to do what has to be done to preserve the status quo for the time being.  You sense that he has hopes that you might somehow help him and his people to overcome the bonds of slavery, but that for the moment survival is the key.Still, feeling the awesome power of the full force of his mind is an experience you would not be willing to endure again.  You vow to one day free yourself from the bonds that hold you and the Vell-os in thrall to your Bureau masters.                                       £"The cargo must be picked up on Rauther in the Rautherion system," he continues after you nod in agreement.  "It is a shipment of new technology that we cannot allow to be sold to the Federation.  It will upset the balance of power a lot if the Federation does receive this technology.  The only problem is that we cannot tell you what the cargo is.  However, I can tell you that the passenger you will be collecting is Tomak Gemmel, grandson of Jiorgen Gemmel, CEO of Rauther Heavy Power Industries.  Tomak wishes to defect to the Rebellion, and bring his new technology with him.  I need you to rescue him."You finish your drink, telling Frandall that you will get Tomak back, however long it takes.  You may have to lay low for a couple of days, or even weeks.  Frandall nods.  If anyone understands the complexities of the spy game it is him.  You say your goodbyes, and head for Rauther.                                       ﬂ"On Rauther, collect your shipment from docking bay 94, and deal only with the cargo handlers there.  You manifest will say 'engine manifolds', but instead they will load a number of crates of Polaron Cannons.  Another group of techs will also take some time installing a Light Polaron Cannon to your ship.  They are still only prototypes, and won't be coming into the Federation Lineup for at least a few years.  If we implement them first, we will have a HUGE advantage over the Federation.  The other great thing about this mission is that all the pirates that attacked you last time will come out again, because the leak will tell them to do so.  But armed to the teeth and with Ion Dissipators, you will have the upper hand.  Kill them all.  Blow them from this world.  While you take care of that end, we will take care of the leak."You point out to Frandall that the entire Federation Navy wants to catch up with you, and that landing on Federation-controlled planets with your record will be more than a little tricky.  He grins at you, before explaining that rebel techs were cleaning your Federation record even as he is speaking.  You ask him to thank them, grab your gear, and head for your ship.                                       QYou nod to Skinny, saying that you knew where McGraw was, and that you'd be happy to do business with him.  He grins, showing stained and chipped teeth."I jus' knew you'd be seein' it my way," he grinned, slapping you on the back.  You tell him that you are going to go and do the job.  You quickly get your ship started up and point it in the direction of the Lalande 21185 system to go and find Dan McGraw.  After all, these engine upgrade outfits will make your organization into a true force, capable of running through even the toughest blockades...                                       Olaf takes out a datapad and hands it to you."I've heard rumors of problems with workers on <DST>.  If you get into any problems, give this data pad to Billy Booya in the Consignments office.  He'll sort it out for you."You wonder where Olaf finds the time to gather all this information but it would be unwise to question its validity.  He is rarely wrong, and even though it has happened, he has never been utterly wrong."The shipment we need is a rare alloy, that is very malleable.  It will be used in the creation of droids.  I don't know exactly how it is useful, but that isn't our concern, is it?  All we need to know is that we need that alloy."You shrug, take the data pad, bid Olaf farewell, and head for the door.                                       Ù"Good, I'm glad you're game.  It isn't going to be easy.  The ship was lost deep in what we now call 'Wraith Space'.  The last transmission said that they had patched their hyperdrive back into working order, but that it was running off main ship power in order to get them moving.  It is presumed that the ship was half ionized by a bad set of power connections, but we really don't know."I need you to head out to the Don'U'Cusyon system, find the ship, and take as much forced matrix Iridium Cuprite as your hold can carry.  Apparently, we only need a little bit, but I'd like to have a stockpile of the stuff, just in case.  It was originally used in old hyperdrive reactors, but a much more stable substitute is now used.  However, our man assures me that he can use this stuff to make a better warp bubble, and keep it more stable.  It should cut your warp times substantially, but I must admit, I have my doubts.  So get out there and see if you can find that ship."                                       ú"That's great," he booms, a little too loudly and you wince as many of the patrons look around in interest.  "We want to set up our base camp on <RST> in the <RSY> system.  Initially it will just be me and the other ten members of the team, plus some of the equipment we need.  But it won't be long until we will be requiring your services for more equipment."We are prepared to pay you 25000 credits for your services on this trip," he continues quickly, as if suddenly remembering something.  "When can we leave?"You ask him how long it will take him and his team to load up your vessel."Around three hours or so," he replies, slightly puzzled.  "Why?"With a slight smile at his naivete you tell him that you can be ready to leave in about three hours."Oh!" he exclaims, suddenly understanding.  "Then we had better get to work, eh?"You nod, and head off towards your ship.                                       ó"Oh, thank you," he tells you, sighing in relief.  "We are basically stuck at a standstill until we can get ahold of some of this stuff."The equipment should be waiting for you in the Deliveries Office on <DST> in the <DSY> system," he tells you earnestly, "and should only come in at around <CQ> tons in total.  If you could head over there and bring it back here that would be great.  I've managed to get the head office to give me an extra 25000 credits to pay for your services, but they are only prepared to transfer the money over to you once you have made the delivery, so it'll be waiting for you when you get back."                                       ‚"Okay," he begins seriously, "up until now we have been keeping our target planet a secret because of the possibility of a media circus if we fail.  I mean, look at Mars.  The scientists who were involved in that are still vilified today.  However I have little choice but to reveal to you the planet we have chosen for our experiments, since you're going to be taking us there, but I would ask that you keep the information a secret, okay?"You shrug and nod."Great!" he sighs forcefully.  "We need to be relocated to <RST> in the next system.  That's the planet that is the target.  We will need about four hours to load the necessary equipment onto your ship.  We can leave any time after that."                                       You immediately head down to the Deliveries Office and tell them that you are here to pick up the colonists, and after a few minutes wait they inform you that the colonists will meet you outside your ship in one hour.An hour later you see ten families coming towards your ship, and you greet them all and get them aboard as quickly as possible.                                       í"Glad to have you on board," she says with a measured smile.  'We need a shipment of parts for experimental weapons we are working on.  We have <CQ> tons on order and they are currently being held in storage on <DST> in the <DSY> system.  We need them to be returned to here by <DL>.

"So to facilitate this we have offered the captain of the pirate raider '<SN>' a substantial sum of money if he can defeat you in combat.  As a part of the deal he has to share with us his sensor logs of the battle, so that we can find out if the weapon performed up to expectations.  The same restriction applies to you, but we will be giving you the Polaron Cannon to use against him."You will find the <SN> in the Naka system waiting for you," she tells you quietly.  "Good luck."You find yourself a little stunned at the tactics used by GLi-tech to get battle data on their weapons, but in the end you suppose that a weapons manufacturer wants to be absolutely sure that their weapon will do what they say it will when the crunch time comes. ˚"This time we are testing the new etheric wake missile," she tells you quietly.  "We will be giving a missile launcher to you, as well as a few etheric wake missiles for it."Like last time we have hired a pirate raider," she informs you in a professional voice, "this one is called the '<SN>', and it will be paid a significant sum of money if it destroys you.  It will once again be located in the Naka system.  When you are finished, return here with all your data." |                                    r"We want to have a look at what the Polaris call the 'Wraith Cannon'," she tells you quietly.  "We know it uses Polaron technology, and we want to know a little more about it.  So we want you to go to <DST> in the <DSY> system and take a few photographs of a Wraith Cannon, and the 'Wraithii' it fires."If we can get our hands on this technology," she shares with you slyly, "it will be worth billions.  So if you make it back here, we are prepared to pay you 500000 credits.  Believe me, if you can get past Polaris security and make it back here in one piece, you will have earned it."                                       x"Excellent," she thanks you with a smile.  "It will be the usual deal, we will give you a Wraith Cannon, as well as a few Wraithii, and the pirate ship '<SN>' will be waiting for you in the Naka system.  Head out there and do your thing..."Good luck," she tells you sincerely as she stands up to leave.  "I'll see you when you get back." ¡"Great!" he exclaims with a wide smile.  "We currently have a shipment of <CQ> tons of <CT> waiting in storage on <DST> in the <DSY> system.  If you could head over there, pick it up and return here, making sure that you land on the area of the Kane Band owned by Sigma Shipyards, that would be great."Any problems?" he asks seriously.  "No?  Well, then, I expect that I'll be seeing you again in a few weeks."                                       `As soon as the Deliveries Office is notified that you have accepted the bulk delivery they snap to work with a easy-looking efficiency.

They make sure that all your passengers show up and then leave everything else up to you.  It takes you the better part of two hours to get everybody in place and their gear stowed correctly.  But eventually you slide into your pilots chair with an exhausted sigh and begin preparing your ship for the coming spaceflight. é ÕUnder the cover of darkness your passengers begin boarding.  Oddly enough there are no hassles and everybody does everything you tell them to the first time.  Perhaps the idea that their government would disapprove of their actions has scared them into sensibility.Anyway, the entire boarding procedure take you little more than 45 minutes and you waste no time in starting to prepare your ship for the coming spaceflight. ¨As you nod in response to his question, he looks so proud as to almost burst."You're a credit to your blood, young'un, d'ye know?  If Morgan was here he'd..." Uncle Olaf trails off as he becomes lost in memory."Well.  You're here now; what am I to do with you?  I suppose I'd better give you something to keep you occupied until I can make some better plans.  Are ye up to taking care of some business for me?  It's nothing arduous, just a shuttle run to the Sol system to pick up a cargo of data crystal replacements.  Ye'll handle it for your old uncle?" he asks with that silly, beatific smile you remember from so long ago."Of course, Uncle," you reply.He smiles again, and hugs your shoulders.  "Good for you, Bonnie," he laughs, using the pet-name from your childhood.  "Now, how's about a drink?"With that, you become pleasantly lost in talk until you have leave to start the cargo run.                                       JThe stock turns out to be a number of Data Cubes.  It all looks to be pretty bland stuff, educational films and the like.  You find a copy of "Jaws 557 - Sharks in Space" and chuckle to yourself.  The shark still looked fake.  Olaf returns with a loader and the two of you begin to push cargo.                                       _Olaf walks beside you, and briefs you on your up-coming trip on the way."You've got to get to <DST>, but I'm afraid it might be harder than ye might think.  Ye're going to be shipping some incredibly expensive military hardware for the Federation Navy.  In an attempt to avoid being attacked by a huge Pirate fleet while so much action is going on the Auroran Border, the fleet is shipping the most vital components on private freighters.  The mission is very hush-hush, but ye should take care anyway.  The criminal underbelly would love to lay their hands on this stuff, not to mention the Aurorans.  Take care, and be as quick as possible.  Once ye're done, come back and see me here.  I'll have more work for ye.  What we will make from this will speed up my plans by a substantial amount.  So god-speed, and good luck."                                       'The story that Olaf has told you has made your blood boil."Where do I begin?" you ask."Remember, the secret of having a strong organization is to have lots of members.  Even now, many old hands keep at their trades, slipping secret shipments of contraband through Federation Space.  The structure of the Association is still pretty much in place, less those who joined the rebels."The first thing ye have to do is convince 'em ye're trustworthy.  I's held as much together in these past years as I could.  I know I prob'ly should have told ye about it, but I didn't want to place ye under any pressure.  The past few runs have been very good, and the people I have kept in contact with are happy to sign on."You should go to <RST> in the <RSY> system and speak to Dace.  She was yer father's bookkeeper in the old days, and she's minded things as best she could.  I'm afraid that some of yer father's money has gone to funding things for the Rebels, but I knew that was where yer father's allegiance would have been if he had lived.  However, there is still a large inheritance to be collected from Dace."Also let her know that the Association is back under way again, and to expect membership fees to be coming in soon.  Once ye have done all that, head back here to me."                                       …"Now the meeting will take place on the <RST> station in the <RSY> system.  Be ready for lots of security, but don't let that phase ye.  This meeting is pretty much a formality.  Most of the rebel freighter pilots are either old members of the Association, or their fathers were.  They'll jump at the chance to revive the old system, for it is easier for them to work for us.  Once ye're seen to be organizing things again, the membership fees will start rolling in.  Soon we will have enough people to start taking on the Pirate gangs who live off the fat pickings in the galaxy.  And once we do, ye'll be amazed who they work for.  But for now, just get out to that meeting.                                       ;"I have been working on something for ye, but it is a surprise, and I need ye to travel around and pick up a few people for me before it will be ready.  First I need Blind Charlie from <DST> in the <DSY> system.  Now many folks think to look down on Charlie because he is blind, but he is the best communications operator I have ever met.  His ear is incredible.  He'll tell ye if the guy on the other end of a hailing channel is lying, because he'll be able to pick the tension in his voice.  He's that good.  So go and pick him up."                                       ~Once you are able to raise your head, you make your way to the spaceport.  The journey to <RST> will take some time, but then again, you have a feeling that Olaf is sending you away for some time for a reason.  It makes you a little mad that no-one will tell you what is going on, with but you realize that you have yet to earn all your stripes.                                        „On the way to your ship you begin to piece together what Olaf is up to.  First a Comms man, followed by a sensor-man.  A crew chief and a Helmsman ... was Olaf forming a crew?  But for what?                                       Olaf suggests that the maiden voyage of the best carrier in the universe should be to head out to <RST> in the <RSY> system and try to discover why the Association has been losing so many ships so near the small supply depot Olaf recently opened on the planets surface.Bright and early, you meet your new bridge crew on your new ship.  The surfaces of the various consoles gleam with a freshness that you find enticing.  With a happy heart you order Flynn McHugh to break contact with the base and head for the <RSY> system.As the ship makes its way out of the port, you set the course into the ships computer Dala.  Dala calculates the best course for and you drop into warp.  One way or the other you will discover what is happening in <RSY>.                                       You enter the bridge of the <PSN> to find all of your crew sitting expectantly at their consoles.  You pick up the hailer, and ask for Olaf and Ferret to report to the bridge.  The two men appear in moments, and you begin to tell them about the findings of Horatio.  When you have finished, the faces before you are full of a grim purpose."I know that many of you have reasons for hating McGowan, and I say that letting the rebels go and remove him from this world would be betraying all the memories that we hold dear, and disregarding the very tenets upon which the Association of Free Traders was built.  Tyranny and injustice must be fought, and they must be fought by those who have stomach for the fight."Mr. Ferret, inform the crew that we are headed for battle.  Olaf, make ready the engines.  I want optimum power by the time we reach <RST>."Dizzy, make sure that you are ready to fly like you have never flown before, and Mr. Fjordnham, keep the information coming to my screens.  I need to know which ships are weakening, and which ships are still in full flight.  Blind Charlie, signal the rest of the fleet to form on <PSN> and make themselves ready for battle.  We go to end a great evil, and by all that is sacred, we will succeed in our task." $"{G"Mr" "Ms"}. Reliable as always," Sharon grins and Krane nods with a small smile.  "Two of these ships will be waiting for you in the Barnard's Star system.  Disable but DO NOT destroy either of them and when you have finished, return here.""Of course," Krane takes up the briefing easily, "if everything works out as it should, you will be given access to the new ships as soon as they reach the production line."You nod, stand up and shake the hands of the two women and start heading towards your ship.                                       ËYou awake in the morning with a heavy head, and there is far too much light in the cabin.  The instruments are too bright, and you cannot remember ever feeling quite so awful.  Michaleen doesn't appear to be much better, but takes a very philosophical view of your predicament."Just remember that you can only start to feel better when you feel this bad at the beginning," he tells you with grim humor.Somehow, it does make sense in a bizarre way.                                        ÅYou tell Michaleen that you would be happy to take him back.  Next day you head back to Sol.                                       @Michaleen's dying wish was that you return to New Ireland and inform his people that he had fallen.  You will return, and then come seeking your revenge.  It is with great sadness that you lift off and set course for New Ireland, sending a message ahead of you passing on the news...                                       ÕFlannigan concludes his briefing with an outline of the plan to come.  The Rovers would separate and enter the Sol system.  Each two man team would be responsible for the destruction of a different sphere of McGowan's organization.  By the time each team had finished their tasks they would return to New Ireland."O' course, we're a man down.  Or rather, we were 'til you arrived," he says as he claps a hearty hand over your shoulder.You tell Flannigan that you would be honored to take part in this operation, and that you owed Michaleen that much."In that case," he continues smoothly, "I want you to go to Mairim in the Hannaford System.  Flynn will go with you, and he will be in command of a team of our special operations commandos.  When you get there you will need to locate the wreck of a freighter called 'South of the Border'.  It crashed nearly 80 years ago on the icy steppes.  McGowan has made the wreck habitable again, and has been using it as a Tobacco and Hammerhead processing facility.  It is a handy arrangement for McGowan.  Mairim is close enough to Sol that it doesn't take too long to ship the product back.  However, since Mairim doesn't have any official government, McGowan has been able to have a steady influx of income without having any police trouble.  I want you two to go and fix the situation.  All of the workers there are convicted criminals that McGowan has been able to secure as part of a governmental work contract.

After that, meet me back here for the next phase of the operation."One final thing," he mutters, looking straight at you, "as the new member of our team, if at any time things get too out of hand for us to survive here, look up my friend, Professor F Cook, on Misfire in the Trishka system, and I won't be far away."                                       ’"Good for you.  Here is the deal.  We'll load the containers onto your ship.  You have to take them to <DST> in the <DSY> system.  McGowan has a distribution center there.  When you arrive, tell the dock-workers that the containers are for Marguerite Harris.  They will ask when you want them delivered, and you MUST respond with 'Before six tomorrow, and make it snappy'.  If you don't, they will assume you are a plant, and more likely than not try to kill you.  Even if you escape, you'll still have a hold full of explosives to get rid of.  So make sure you have it right.  Get the shipment there ASAP, as I'll need to make McGowan sweat in order to take my plans to the next phase."Also," he adds with a quiet grin, "you might want to avoid Federation patrols, as I don't think they appreciate people who ship large amounts of explosives from place to place.  Any questions?"You tell Flannigan that you have it, and head for your ship.                                       5"I'm so glad you have decided to take on this mission," he slaps you on the shoulder with a grin.  "I could task some Geese to do it, but we are glad of the anonymity that your 'privateer' position gives us.  You have proven to be more than trustworthy, and we are very pleased with the progress we have made with you on our side."You feel the hot flush of a blush rushing into your face at Flannigan's praise."You'll find the 'Desperation' in the NGC-1894 system and you'll have to take care of her escorts before you can disable her and board.  Once you do, take the prisoners aboard your ship, and bring them back here.  Sound simple, huh?  I can assure you it that it won't be.  The 'Desperation' is notoriously well guarded.  But with your skill you should be able to do it."                                       "Okay then," Eamon begins tersely.  "I want you head to up to the Rebel II station in the Koria system and meet with a guy who I know as Geoff Daniels.  All I really know is that he is a spook that is fairly high up in the rebel intelligence network, and I very much doubt that his real name is anything resembling Geoff."Regardless," he shrugs diffidently, "he seems to be a decent person, and if we ask him to help us out by pointing us in the direction of someone who may be able to help us in finding out more about McGowan and his pirate 'guild' I'm fairly sure he will help us."Once you have found out what you need to know," Flannigan finishes seriously, "either return here or follow up on whatever leads you are given.  I'll leave it up to you."With that he claps you on the shoulder and turns back into the crowd heading off in the same direction that Tara, Sean and Ryan took your passengers.  You cannot help but feel as though it may be a fair while before you see any of them again...                                       À"Oh well," he grimaces as he levers himself up and helps you to your feet, "we had better get back to New Ireland to inform the man himself of what has occurred, because I very much doubt McGowan will be prepared to leave this one alone."You look surprised to here the obvious trepidation in his tone."Fighting Pennant and his lap-dogs is one thing," he shakes his head, blood still dripping down his face from several cuts on his forehead, "telling Eamon Flannigan about it is another thing.  You think I look bad now, you wait until the next time he drags me along to one of his training sessions.  I'll be in hospital for months!"You don't think you get to be leader of as unruly a mob as the Wild Geese without being able to crack together a few heads," he grunts as the two of you head back to your ship, "now do you?"Despite the pain you cannot help but grin at Michaleen and his wonderfully warped view of the universe.                                       ,You tell Flannigan that you would be honored to take part in this operation, and that you owe McGowan and his sidekick Pennant that much."In that case," he grins good-naturedly, "I want you to go to Mairim in the Hannaford System.  Flynn will go with you, and he'll be in command of a team of our special operations commandos.  When you get there you will need to locate the wreck of a freighter called 'South of the Border'.  It crashed nearly 80 years ago on the icy steppes.  McGowan has made the wreck habitable again, and has been using it as a Tobacco and Hammerhead processing facility.  It is a handy arrangement for McGowan.  Mairim is close enough to Sol that it doesn't take too long to ship the product back.  However, since Mairim doesn't have any official government, McGowan has been able to have a steady influx of income without having any police trouble.  I want you two to go and fix the situation.

McGowan's headquarters are on the station called 'Harbor' in the Scheall system to the galactic north of the Federation.  Good luck."With that he turns on his heel and heads out of the bar leaving Michaleen behind."I'll be thanking you as well," Michaleen grins shamelessly.  "If you had refused, it would have been me going!  And I know that McGowan holds me in no high regard since it was me that caused this whole thing.  Anyway, I had best be catching up to Flannigan or else he'll have me back in training again!"With a wink and a saucy grin, Michaleen heads off after Flannigan.                                       ª"Okay then," Eamon begins tersely.

You head off to the meeting point, but something tells you that the port is a little bit too quiet.It is with great relief you see a man matching Tomak's description waiting for you.  He sees you approach, waves, picks up a large case and heads over to you, just as a squad of Bureau agents round the corner.  You whip out your blaster and open fire.  Bolts fizz past the two of you as you sprint for your ship.  After deft turns and ducking through a bar, you somehow manage to lose your pursuers.  At your ship, you breath a sigh of relief when the harbor-master gives you your clearance vector.  Breaking any number of port laws, you blast away from the station.Tomak is visibly shaken, and you can tell that despite his development work, he has never heard weapons fired in anger.  As you reassure him that you should be okay now that you have reached open space, the sensors begin to sound alarms.  Outside, the Federation Navy is vectoring a large number of ships to stop you.

A hologram of Techerakh springs from the tiny projector, and Techerakh quickly tells you that the Council has need of your presence immediately.  You rush to the Great Hall.As soon as you enter, you are rushed into the main tactics room.  Warriors stand around the walls, guarding the important House figures within.  Techerakh glances up from a map of the nearby systems, and waves you over.  "I have a mission for you," he says.

He scrutinizes you before asking if you had any news of Thurmbiir Flaming Wings.  This is an older code for Heraan contacts, and at first you balk.  After a few uncertain moments, you reply that Thurmbiir is well.  He smiles.  As he reaches out a hand in friendship, you sense all is not right.  You disable him and drag him into a nearby alleyway.A short time later you have all the information that you need.  The Heraan spy has been discovered, and is currently being held under house arrest, awaiting a Moash Interrogation Squad.At the house, you cruise past the two guards.  As soon as their eyes leave you, you spin, and with one blast end both their lives.  Using one of the guards' fingers to open the door, you dive through, cutting short the military careers of another two men before finding the spy.  The man is in bad shape, but he is Heraan.  He will live.  You cut his bonds and hoist him over your shoulder.  As you bolt to your ship, klaxons and alarms are sounding, and you know that you are going to face some determined enemies as you leave.  Leaping to the controls, you simply hit the bricks, praying that you will break out and get back on your way to Heraan before too many get on your tail...                                        fTake the wounded Heraan spy back to <RST> as quickly as possible.

The Moash were going to allow Federation Fleets safe passage across the Auroran border to attack the Tekel and Dani Houses.  This is HUGE.  It would be enough to turn the Dani and Tekel Houses against the Moash, but coming from us, neither House would believe it.  So it falls to us to stop the threat."The plan called for the Moash Fleets to send coded messages to the Federation Fleets, who would then jump into Auroran space without a shot being fired.

Ordinarily, I would lead one fleet and Kuron the other.

OUpon landing the released Heraan warriors cram into the bridge.  A lean wiry warrior called Ivo Stormbolts steps forward."Wolf, as our new Thurokiir, I must report.  While we rotted in that filthy Federation hulk, a few of us formed close ties with some Vell-os prisoners.  We exchanged pledges.We said we would try to free them - not just busting them out, but instead freeing them from the "Collective".The Vell-os are able to communicate to each other through their thoughts, but at the end of the Vell-os wars, the Federation imprisoned the Vell-os into a controlled version of this "mind".  They made the Vell-os wear collars, which disclosed their thoughts and made them slaves.To free them, the Vell-os said there was an ancient artifact on a planet called Korell that would re-awaken their subconscious minds, giving them more power to break free of the Federation Collective.  They pledged to us that they would give us some information to further our tech development.These Vell-os prisoners were recently transferred to a Medical Research Facility on <DST> in the <DSY> system.  Some of us had been forced to work there, and the experiments are horrific.We ask for leave to rescue them.  We gave our word.  We need to get to <DST> as quick as possible, disable the station and rescue those Vell-os.                                       @You consider all that you have been told.  The stories you have been told of Vell-os capabilities are amazing; near mythical ships that are capable of feats no other ship can match.  The Heraan will be in a position to help these Vell-os and maybe gain a little of the technology the Vell-os used to have.  You ask Ivo if he and his men have had time to plan the attack.He grins, "Wolf, all we used to do all day was plan ways to destroy Federation stations.  We have spent a while working on this Medical station, and so we know what to take out first.  We can brief you on the way.  There is also a more pressing reason to help these Vell-os.  The Feds put large Bombs inside our chest cavities.  Damn things are very uncomfortable, and make breathing a bit hard.  We are given a swipe by a code machine every three months, but as far as we are aware, only the Vell-os have the know-how to remove them.  Each one would blow with enough force to pop your hull, so I suggest we get moving, and fill you in on the way."You hastily agree, and give the order to head for <DST>.  When you get there, you have to somehow gain entry into a high-security medical facility, free a bunch of Vell-os slaves, take them halfway across the known Universe, and then maybe get some new technology.

They are groggy at first, but are soon revived with the expert medical care provided here.  Within hours many of them are looking better, and they explain that their nano-technology enables them to recover far faster than the rest of humanity could hope for."But we need to be moving as soon as possible KarHallarn," says a woman named Llanwyn, who seems to be their spokesperson, "because the Federation will already be on their way here.  We need to get to the planet Korell to gain access to an ancient artifact that will amplify our strength so that we will gain the strength to be free from these damn bonds."Would you be willing to take us?"                                       ´As soon as the Vell-os are capable of moving unaided they are loaded on board your ship and you begin to set out, and not a moment too soon.

You bark the order to go to battle-stations, and lean forward in anticipation of the upcoming fight.                                        çTake the Vell-os to the planet Korell to find an artifact that will enable them to be free from slavery.                                       ILlanwyn steps onto the bridge with a grace you find hard to grasp.  Men and women alike have all been touched by the grace and humility of your passengers, and the gratitude of saving their new shipmates from the terror of the Federation bio-bombs."Wolf," she smiles "You and your crew have suffered terrible privations in order to save us from the Federation, and we are extremely grateful.  However, we have another request to ask of you.  We are in need of transport to the Polaris station they call <RST> in the <RSY> system.  Once we are under the protection of the Polaris, we will be able to begin our fight to free our people telepathically from the Federation's collective.  Would you be willing to transport us there?"You consider for a moment, but your decision is already made.  You have sacrificed for these people, and to deny them now would cheapen the deeds of your warriors terribly.  You tell Llanwyn that you will take them.  She smiles, and tells you the co-ordinates.  It will be a long journey, but no longer than it has been already.                                        àTake the Vell-os to <RST> in the <RSY> system to begin their fight to free the rest of the Vell-os.                                       ®You and your crew are amazed at the response you receive upon entering Polaris space.  A flight of fiendish looking fighters slowly surround your ship, and you are about to call for battle stations when a hailing channel is offered, and an audio only message instructs you to land at the station.Upon landing you are met by an elderly gentleman.  He is old, but still has the look of eagles about him, and you are glad that he wants to talk rather than fight."I am Nil'Rabiska" he says "and you are Wolf.  We have reason to believe that you have Vell-os passengers aboard.  Is this correct?"You tell him that you are Wolf, Thurokiir of Heraan house, and that if he wishes to harm your passengers, he will have a fierce battle on his hands.He smiles, "Proud Arbiter, fear not our blows.  An old communicator left by the Vell-os generations ago awoke from it's slumber ten days ago, and told us to expect your ship.  We are here to escort you to <RST> in the <RSY> system, where you will be permitted to land and rest.  You have done your passengers a great service, and we will honor you."  You gratefully accept his invitation, and head for <RST>.                                       íWhen you land you hand over the data-cube to one of the gathered scientists."This will make for huge advances in technology," she explains excitedly.  "It will take some time to analyze and put to use, but you will be the first to hear of it."With that they quickly scurry away to begin looking at the data, and you grin and shake your head at their excitement.                                       `As you are landing you receive a message from one of the scientists that have been working on the Vell-os Data telling you that he has a surprise for you.  You quickly go through your post-flight routine, your curiosity somewhat piqued, and when you leave your ship you are greeted by a vessel that makes all of the surrounding vessels look pitiful."We've called it the Thunderforge," says one of the scientists quietly, "and we have been working around the clock to finish it.  It has two radar missile launchers with one hundred and fifty radar missiles, two storm chainguns, four fusion pulse turrets and four 150mm railguns.  But what separates her from the rest are the four new weapons she has that are based on the tech from that Vell-os data-cube you gave us.  We call them 'TripHammers', based on how they work and what they will do to your foes."This is the first we have ever built," he continues with quiet pride.  "It will be months before we will complete another, but we thought we would offer this one to you, Arbiter.  We would be honored if you would have her." òThe scientists take you on a tour of your new vessel, and you remain impressed from stem to stern.  With this vessel at your disposal, your enemies will definitely fear your approach.  After completing the tour you remain sitting on the bridge for several minutes silently immersing yourself in the spirit of this mighty vessel before preparing her for her maiden voyage.                                        1No desc reqd                                        1No desc reqd                                        1No desc reqd                                        1No desc reqd                                        To: Ory'haraFrom: P'JeenaWe have made some advances in the design of the cloaking organ and we were wondering if you were interested in helping us with our testing?

Eventually I want to head over to Dunroamin in the Journey's End system, but I tell you what, let's head to Earth in the Sol system, and we'll take it from there."To do that," he explains with a warm smile, "just click the 'Okay' button below and then on the 'Leave' button in the main spaceport.  Once you are back out in space, if you have kept the factory settings for your keys (if not, use the key settings you decided on), hit the 'M' key to bring up the map, and start plotting a course towards Sol (the system with the red arrow pointing at it).  To help you out with this, I'll enter in the Sol coordinates from my pocket-comp."When you're ready," he concludes quietly, "accelerate out to a safe distance from the center of the system and hit the 'J' key to make the jump into hyperspace.  Repeat this as often as you have to.  If you find yourself in a system that doesn't link in a direction you want, just backtrack a little, and if you run out of energy, just land somewhere and refuel."                                        tHead to Earth in the Sol system with Barry so that he can 'show you the ropes'.                                       …"Okay then," he drawls, "in the spirit of buying low and selling high, looking at the prices offered on Earth, you can see that the price of medical supplies is low.  So a good start would be to buy as much of those as you could carry."Now normally," he explains, shrugging, "you would then look around for a while to find a place to sell the goods you have bought, but I just happen to know that Port Kane has a pretty high demand for medical supplies at the minute.  So I reckon we should head there, and once there I'll show you how to make a little money on the way back.  If you want to make a little money in the mean time, you could try buying some medical supplies."                                       w"Okay then," he drawls with that dry smile of his, "help yourself to as much of the equipment as you can, and you can try selling it when you land on <RST>.  However, make sure you sell off whatever medical supplies you bought on Earth first.  Once you've done that, we'll probably head back to Earth where I'll show you some more stuff."                                        eTravel to <RST> in the <RSY> system to learn more about trading.                                        eTravel to <RST> in the <RSY> system to complete the trade route.                                        fHead back to <RST> in the <RSY> system to continue your tutorial.                                       &"Well," he drawls quietly, "let's head over to <RST> in the <RSY> system, and have a look at what they have there.  It's the home of the Rauther Power Industries corporation, and they specialize in all sorts of upgrades."Of course," Barry continues with a wry grin, "most of them will be way beyond your current price range, but they won't always be, and it never hurts to know what's out there."Just as a side note," Barry adds more seriously, "if you can't quite remember what it was you had to do at any time you're on a mission, if you haven't changed the configuration of your keyboard, just press the 'I' key to get a short reminder of your mission goals.  You'll find the feature to be especially useful when you have a couple of missions on the go at once."                                        Head over to <RST> in the <RSY> system to have a look at the different outfitting options.                                       πYou walk into this establishment a little nervously and look around uncertainly until you spot Barry having a drink up the far end of the bar chatting to a man wearing dirty overalls."Hey there {G"m'boy" "lass"}," Barry greets you jovially after the other guy stands up and leaves, smiling and nodding at you as he passes.  "How did things go in the outfitters?"You shrug, trying to look casual, and Barry chuckles."You're getting the hang of this starship captain business pretty quickly," he smiles.  "Well, this is the spaceport bar.  There's one in just about every port throughout the universe.  A lot of back-room business comes through here, and you'll find that a lot of people looking for a ship captain to help them out will tend to come here, so it isn't a bad idea to drop into one every time you land.  You can also check up on the news, and if you want to hire an escort to boost your profits on trade runs, this is the place to be.  If you're into gambling, you can do that too, but myself personally, I've never put much stock in it.  Let's face it, if the establishment wasn't making money from the gambling setup they have, they wouldn't be trying to get people to put their money into it."Anyway," he concludes dryly, "I can't show you much more here.  The more you visit, the more you'll learn.  So instead of having you just ferrying me around the place, how about we get you into the combat stuff?"                                       z"Okay then," he grins broadly.  "You might have noticed the guy I was talking to when you walked in?  Well, he's a local scrap merchant.  He buys ships that have been all but destroyed and pulls them apart and sells everything he can.  I paid him to leave a small derelict Viper in orbit so you can use it as target practice."So why don't you head up there," he smiles, slapping you on the shoulder, "and have a bit of fun.  Once again, if you haven't changed the configurations of your keys, the 'Space-bar' should be the key that fires your primary weapons.  And do try to avoid hitting any other ships, even accidentally, as we really don't want to have to spend our time avoiding angry ships, and especially avoid hitting any Federation ships, as I can guarantee you that you probably won't survive long if you try to take them on."If you want to," he adds, grinning mischievously, "you could try boarding the disabled Viper in orbit.  Just come to a full stop over the top of it, and, if you haven't change the configuration of your keypad, press the 'B' key to board it.  I'm sure you'll figure out what to do from there..."When you're done," he finishes, becoming more serious, "head down to <RST> in the <RSY> system, and I can almost guarantee you that we will see a little bit of serious combat action going on.  Be prepared to keep out of the way." Æ ©Destroy the derelict viper in the Rautherion system before heading down to <RST> in the <RSY> system to see some real combat action.                                        1No desc reqd                                       L"Well, this is the shipyard," comments Barry quietly.  "It doesn't get as much foot-traffic as the outfitters, but most ship captains wish they could spend their money here more often."On the surface," he explains quietly, "it looks simple.  If you want a better ship, you go and buy it, but it isn't always so straightforward.  You see, ships aren't always available, what with shipping delays, and all that.  So sometimes the ship you're looking for might not be around.  And then you have the second-hand ships that other captains are trying to sell to you.  Be very careful of any cheap second-hand ships, as they tend to be nowhere near as good as those that are brand new.  Having said that, there are some very good second-hand deals out there, ships that due to careful maintenance, and clever upgrades, are far more capable than anything you would buy 'off the shelf' so to speak, so don't discount second-hand ships altogether."A good place to start," he comments a little tiredly, "is by upgrading from the Shuttle to the Heavy Shuttle.  It's nearly as capable in space, and it carries more energy, which allows you to jump further, and also a fair bit more cargo and weapon space."Again," he continues off-handedly, "like the outfits, the Federation puts certain limits on the availability of various ships.  Some require you get ahold of a license, others are only available with individual military approval.  Regardless, before you buy any ship, make sure you check out all the information on every ship you are looking at before you make your decision."                                       q"With the shipyard out of the way," murmurs Barry in something of an undertone, "I only have one thing left to show you before I think you have it all under control, but I need to head back to Earth to pick up a few things before I head off to my final destination, so I'll get you to head over there, and we'll take it from there."                                        Head back to <RST> with Barry so that he can pick up a few things and finish tutoring you.                                        <PN> From: Barry FletcherAs you know, I'm looking for passage to <RST> in the <RSY> system, and I thought I would do it in a way that would show you how the Mission BBS works.                                       |As soon as you accept Barry's mission, an audio clipping starts playing."I'm glad to see that you were prepared to take me on for one more journey," the recording says, and you can tell by the tone of his gravelly voice that he was smiling, "I thought you might be sick of me by now."Anyway," he continues more seriously, "I've pretty much passed on to you just about everything you need to survive.  There's a whole lot more that you'll find out as you go, but I think I've given you enough to make sure you keep out of trouble."I'll see you back on board your ship for this one last hurrah."                                        pTake Barry to <RST> in the <RSY> system so that he can finally settle down.                                        hTake Barry to <RST> in the <RSY> system so that he can settle down.

ÈAs you sit sipping your drink, your ears prick up when a couple of Federation soldiers sit at a table near you."I hate this spy crap," one mutters, "why can't these bloody Aurorans just come out in the open and fight like real men?""Oh, come off it," laughs the other as your blood begins to burn, "it's not like our side doesn't try to do the same.  Come on, Syracuse isn't that bad, just a bit polluted.  Chances are that there is no spy up there, even if there was, he'll probably be gone by the time we get there, and we'll just patrol around for a few weeks looking for him and have a holiday from the front.  The girls up there aren't half bad looking either."As both of them grin and get down to some serious drinking, your thoughts turn to your mission.  So far, this is the only lead you have that might be related to Bazara.  It might be a wild goose chase, but you decide to check it out nonetheless and head over to Syracuse in the Galvan system.                                       EYou walk into the outfitter feeling an enormous sense of loss.  You look longingly at all the items you were once able to purchase, but which your implant now forbids you from buying through the orders of the Bureau.  You shake your head, despairing at the nightmare your life has become.                                       5You are quietly sipping your drink when you feel a tap on your shoulder.  You turn to see a pretty young lady with deep auburn hair smiling at you a little uncertainly."You are <PN>, Captain of the <PSN>?" she asks and you nod.  "Oh good!  I have heard that you are a very capable pilot.  Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Mu'Randa, and I need to get to <RST> in the <RSY> system so that I can conduct a business transaction with the Wild Geese.  I am prepared to pay you 20,000 credits for passage."Can you help me?"                                        1No desc reqd                                       KYou're sitting quietly enjoying your own company when the man-mountain who accused you of being spineless all those months ago arrives.  He slides into a chair opposite you."So," he says, "Have you discovered your courage?""And why would you still be looking for me?" you reply, a little nervously."My House remains under a blockade.  Unfortunately, inter-house politics makes it impossible to bring the military might of the House to bear, so I'm asking if you will run cargo to the port of Dominance in the Heraan Cov system.  Interested...?"

He laughs and ruffles your hair with his telekinetic 'fingers'"Well watch closely," he says aloud, "and I will show you how..."You sit down, preparing to follow Fllyraen's mind when suddenly your mind is filled with images of him weaving a javelin into existence around himself.  After a few moments of surprise, you start adjusting to the different method of teaching and begin following Fllyraen's steps, but he suddenly stops you.<we cannot risk giving so much power to a person who has yet to demonstrate that they are prepared to pay the money to register ev nova until you do we cannot allow you to go any further come back when you have registered>With a sad smile he pats you on the shoulder and walks away.                                       ¥You are sitting on one of the few remaining intact bar stools drinking from a cask you found that had the top smashed off by some nameless Wild Geese soldier when you see the muscular figure of Eamon Flannigan walk in."I think that we have done about as much as is worth doing here," he comments as he sits next to you.  "I believe that it is time to talk about my payment."After a moment of thought you suggest that it might be best to go and talk to the Heraan elders before trying to rescue Raczak.  Eamon looks at you with renewed respect."I like your thinking," he nods approvingly before turning to regard you more seriously.  "Unfortunately, you haven't yet registered EV Nova, and until you do, I refuse to place my trust in you.  Simply put, you need to earn my respect, and there is only one way you can do that."Come back when you have registered," he smiles gently, "and we'll talk further."                                       èYou see 'Dorraj' walk into the bar as you sit sipping your drink.  You observe him for a long moment before waving to attract his attention.  You wonder what would drive a Federation President to take the enormous risk of contacting the Rebels.  You mentally shrug, thinking that it will prove irrelevant once you make your report to Krane."Here is the return message," he tells you pulling out a small message pod from under his coat.  "Unfortunately, it has come to my attention that you are yet to register EV Nova.  As a result I'm not 100% sure that you are trustworthy, hence I'm afraid I cannot take the risk of letting our relationship continue."Come back when you have registered," he smiles, "and we'll talk further."In the back of your mind you are thinking about what Krane will do to you if you screw this up.  You resolve to register as soon as possible.                                       ëNo sooner have you touched down than there is a commotion on the flightdeck.  You barely have time to disembark before a Dechtakars messenger steps forward and delivers you a data chip.  You quickly load it into your wristcomp, and read the contents of the communique.  You gasp as you read, "House Moash has accused the Heraani of neglecting their duty to the Auroran Empire by not providing enough troops and vessels to man the Federation border."  You allow the rage to build inside you as you read further.  "They also accuse House Heraan of being in league with the Federation and of using their influence with the mortal enemies of the Auroran Empire to destroy the other four Houses in preparation for seizing the Empire."  The audacity of the Moashi amazes you.  They have accused House Heraan of all the actions they themselves have undertaken.  The communique informs you that the ideal situation would be for you to travel to Aurora and speak on behalf on House Heraan.  However, because you have not yet registered EV Nova, such a course of action would be an unacceptable loss of face for the House, so, for the moment, the House Heraan must endure the shame being heaped on it.  The final signoff tells you to come back when you have registered.You coldly resolve to register as soon as possible so as to be able to defend Heraan honor against the lies of the Moashi dogs.                                       ãOlaf and Charlie embrace warmly, and you get the impression that there is a lot of history between them.  That night at the bar they reminisce about old times, and there is much laughter."So," Charlie waves at you "When are you going to go and get the others.  God knows you'll need them.""Others?  What others," you ask, "and why will I need them?""All in good time <PN>" Olaf slaps you on the back "but before you do, some of the new investors coming on board need a show of good faith.  They need to see that you will do the right thing whenever it becomes necessary to do so.  You see, a couple of them have noticed that you haven't registered your copy of EV Nova, and that has given them a few doubts regarding your character."Look," explains your Uncle, "I know what kind of person you are, and so does everyone else here, but these people need a show of good faith, and until you register, we're not going to get anywhere."So until you could go ahead and register," he concludes quietly, "we're going to be stuck here.""Come back when it's done," he smiles, patting you on the shoulder before walking away.                                        1No desc reqd                                        You are sitting in the bar, listening to the abysmal music blaring from a nearby juke-bot and sipping your latest brew when you notice a strangely dressed man walking towards you."Hey {G"dude" "babe"}, you must be <PN>!  You mind if I call you <PNN>?"  Without asking he sits down at your table and looks about.  You are wondering what this is all about when he suddenly turns back to you, saying, "Man, I have no idea how you people ever do business in places like this.  I mean, look at the types here.  They don't even have any dress sense, man.  Kinda makes you feel sorry for them."You look at the bizarre collection of bright colors, odd cuts and stupid fabric that make up what this individual calls clothing, and raise your eyebrow."Yeah, right {G "man" "babe"}, sorry," the man shrugs, "I should get down to the real deal.  My name is Sly Styles, rock and roll entrepreneur and manager of the hottest band in Federation space, Debris Field.  We have a major tour on, but the guy who was handling our security has gone and gotten himself splattered by pirates.  Now, we only have two shows left on the tour, but the hardest part is that they're at the extremes of Federation controlled space.  We could lose huge amounts of flash if we have to pull out," he notices the bemused look on your face, and pauses."Flash?" you ask him."Yeah, you know, Scrunner, Flash...Moolah, credits."You nod your understanding, saying "So you want me to handle your security for the rest of the tour?""Yeah, rock on, {G"man" "babe"}!  Our old security dude said you were on the sharp end of the Electrotrancer, and I see he was right.  That's exactly what we want you to do.  It's only two more gigs and then easy days.  We'll pay you 50,000 per gig.  For that we need to get to the shows on time, have somewhere to stow all the gear, the band, myself and the other stuff.  Our spacies are already there setting up the major gear, so all you need to worry about are the instruments and stuff.  What do you say?"                                       You nod, sticking out your hand."Boooyah!"  Styles yells, grabbing your hand and pumping up and down at a rate of knots.  "I should take you to meet the rest of the guys and start getting our stuff together."You leave the bar and head across to a plush looking hotel.  Styles breezes through a throng of teenage girls standing around on the pavement, slipping between them with practiced ease."You'll get used to this sort of thing quick enough.  Happens everywhere we go."Once inside you head to the elevator, which goes all the way to the top floor.  Upon walking out you see the most filthy collection of individuals sitting around the worst kept hotel room in history.  All around you are empty bottles, cans, food trays and overflowing ashtrays.  The smell makes you gag.Styles doesn't seem to notice, and calls you over to meet the band.  Some dirty guys stand up, and you cannot believe that they are even a band, let alone successful.  Styles introduces you, and you try to avoid throwing up at the smell.  You make your excuses, saying that you had better go and get the ship prepped, asking Styles where the next show is."It's in the Full Noise Megadrome on <RST> in the <RSY> system.  We'll meet you down at the ship tomorrow?"You nod your agreement before heading for the door.  You hear the band begin to play as you walk to the lift, and hear the same abysmal crud that was playing in the bar.  Suddenly you don't feel too good, knowing that you'll have to listen to this for a while.                                       ¨You stand around at the Debris Field Concert, watching hordes of teenage girls scream at them.  The concert is to promote the band's new album, "Groove 'til You Vomit", and you don't think that you would have to groove too long before you'd bring up your lunch.The concert goes without a hitch, but afterwards, as you wait for the band to come back to the ship, you see a number of unsavory types hanging around.  You get the impression that they are waiting for the band to board the ship, and then tell their friends aloft which ship was carrying the band.  You feel like telling them that if they want to kill them, you won't interfere, just so long as the thugs can guarantee that there won't be a memorial album, but a job is a job.You watch as the thugs disappear, but you get the feeling that you will have some rumbles on your way to the next gig, on the planet of <RST> in the <RSY> system.                                       ®You are sitting enjoying a few moments of peace and quiet when you see a gaggle of what you presume to be scientists headed your way.  You can tell this by the nervous looks and constant checking over the shoulder routine."Ah, are you <PN> of the <PSN>?"  one of them asks as they get closer.  You nod, and indicate that they should all sit down."Pleased to meet you," the designated spokesman begins.  "My name is Jerry O'Donnell, and my colleagues and I are keen to employ you."You wait, wondering if any of these people have ever been outside a lab in their recent memory."We are studying the possibility of further systems beyond the Known Universe to the Galactic South, and are planning a probe launch in the space down there.  However, we are unable to pilot a vessel down to our launch point ourselves.  Is it possible, for a modest reimbursement, that you could take us there?"You sit back, enjoying the thought of making them sweat a little."Two things," you say. "Where's the launch point and how much to get you there?""Well," a very nervous Jerry begins, looking over his shoulder, "we need to launch from the Kontik system, and second, we will be happy to pay you 50,000 for the trouble of getting us there.  What do you say?"You've heard all the stories about Kontik, and about how no one ever comes back alive from trying to study the place.  On the other hand, 50,000 is 50,000.                                       ì"I guess I'd be prepared to take you down there, but I have to stress that it will be a tough trip," you tell them."Yes, <PN>, we have looked over the maps.  We know how long the trip will be and what it will entail.  We are prepared to leave whenever you are.  All we have to do is load the probe and our launching equipment.  Of course, we will also need you to return us back to <RST> once the probe is launched."You nod, and tell them to meet you at the spaceport in the morning.  They smile at you, thank you for your time, and head off.

"My name is Temmin Shard... investigator.  I was wondering if I could have a word to you?"Your hand drifts towards your blaster in an almost instinctive move.  Something about this man isn't quite right.  He strikes you as being a dangerous individual."I wouldn't do that if I were you," he warns, pushing his jacket open to reveal a modified shot blaster.  "I have an investigators license.  Legally, I could kill you and not see the inside of a prison hulk."You place your hands on the tabletop as Shard steps forward and sits down."I'm glad you didn't decide to test me, <PN>.  I'm here to hire you, not to have a fire-fight.  I have been hired by the Federal government to track down some stolen Vell-os artworks.  They were stolen from the First Federal Gallery and Museum on Sol.  The Feds have hired me to track them down and return them intact.  Apparently they are supposed to have some form of 'mystical' symbolism to the Vell-os people.  The Government have of course debunked this notion, but by the same token, they are paying handsomely for their return.""Well, what do you need me for?" you ask "You can obviously look after yourself.""The thing is that I need another ship to go with me," he confides.  "I have traced the artworks to a certain cargo convoy.  They have quite an escort, and I need you to disable the Leviathan and board it while I hold them off.  I will pay you 30,000 for your services.  Are you keen?"                                       ´You nod.  You have a feeling that the safest place to be will be close to this Temmin Shard character.  You don't think that he would kill you just to keep you quiet, but space travel and shady characters have given you a good nose for situations, and something smells fishy here."Meet me in orbit tomorrow.  I'll be flying in a modified Starbridge.  We'll jump out to <RST> in the <RSY> system, where the convoy is leaving from.  Once there I'll set up some surveillance.  See you tomorrow."Shard turns and heads for the door.  You head for your ship, too.  There's no way you're going to go all the way to Boral I with your engine rattling.

You quickly run your decoder over it and scan the message.  Shard wants you to take off straight away, and meet him 'up top'.  The message ends with a cryptic question, asking if you are really sure if you are ready to take on this job.  You wonder what is going on.  You resolve to ask Shard the first chance you get.  But then, should you just message back that you have engine problems and decline to help him?Do you take on the mission?                                       ÌYou are preparing to leave the bar when Shard opens a hailing channel."We are going to make our attack on the convoy as they arrive in the Arcturus system.  Remember, head for the Leviathan.  I'll take care of the escorts.  Once we have the artifacts, meet me on <RST> in the <RSY> system."He terminates the channel, and you find yourself wondering why he insists on being a man of few words.  Sighing, you start mentally preparing yourself for battle.                                        üDisable and board the Leviathan in the Arcturus system, pick up the stolen art and then head to <RST> in the <RSY> system.                                        1No desc reqd                                        'You are sitting quietly enjoying a cold drink, when the man beside you turns and starts up a conversation.  The space {G"jock" "chick"} lifestyle is a fairly lonely one, with months between seeing old friends, and you are more than happy to chat away for a while with him.  It turns out that he is an Auroran living in Federation space.  When he told you, you looked at him somewhat skeptically, but once he explained that he was watched by the government very carefully, and had to log all his travel and movements, you can see that this might be possible.  Charengo has been living in Fed space since his House cast him out.  Your limited knowledge of the Auroran lifestyle gives you enough of an idea not to question him further; these things are always a matter of honor, and best left alone.During the course of the night it becomes apparent that Charengo is something of an entrepreneur, and has organized for a number of Federation citizens to go to Hourglass and hunt the dreaded Cunjo.  He has a number of expatriate Auroran warriors to act as guides, and enough weapons to destroy a small Federation battle group.  He has run a number of successful hunts, but has run into a snag.  His regular pilot was killed when a Cunjo ripped him to pieces.  So now he has a party ready to leave, but no one to get them there.Suddenly, a light comes to his eyes, and you can all but see a light bulb appear next to him.  "Say," he asks, "what are you doing tomorrow?  Do you feel up to ferrying us to Hourglass and dropping us off back at Earth?  It won't be too dangerous, the Cunjos aren't mating at the moment."You look at him in a mixture of disbelief.  You have never seen a Cunjo, but you really don't want to.Charengo sees your expression, smiles and leans closer, "There is big money in this.  If you do it for me, I'll always be in your debt.  And I'll pay you 75,000.  You won't have to go on surface for very long, and you won't even have to leave your ship.  Even in mating season, Cunjo can't tear through metal."What do you say?                                       €You stick out your hand, and Charengo grasps it."I really should be getting everything organized," he smiles warmly.  "I'll meet you at your ship tomorrow.  I'll have my team with me, and four clients, three of which are public servants who are out for a thrill, and one who is a much more serious hunter.  We'll probably stay on <RST> for a few days, depending on how the hunt goes, and then we'll return to Earth when we're finished."                                        ûTake Charengo, his team and his clients to Hourglass for a few days to hunt Cunjo, before returning to Earth for payment.                                       —Charengo has just spent an hour guiding you to a well used landing site.  All around there is dense forest, and the undergrowth is just starting to cover a huge number of deep craters.  You set down, and the sensors are going wild.  As soon as you do, Charengo and his team leap out of the hatch, brandishing their weapons with gusto.  Behind them come the clients, three looking like they should be wearing brown underpants, the fourth eyeing the undergrowth intently.  You cycle the hatch closed and watch.  A Cunjo suddenly breaks from the undergrowth, flying through the air to attack one of Charengo's men.  At least it would have, if a rocket hadn't plowed into its chest before detonating the beast into a rapidly expanding pink vapor cloud.  The public servants leap to the ground, pointing their weapons in every direction at once.Charengo lays about with a continuous laser, and in the space of a few minutes the clearing you landed in is three times the size.  His men set up the mines and sentry lasers, and the camp takes shape.You stayed on Hourglass for four days.  The public servants never fired their weapons, but still had some "very manly" holoshots taken with killed Cunjos.  The fourth client made some kills on his own, but they all looked on in disbelief when Charengo and the guides explained that in the Auroran Empire, warriors hunt Cunjo with hand to hand weapons.  All too soon, you have packed up and are heading home.                                       `As soon as the Deliveries Office is notified that you have accepted the bulk delivery they snap to work with a easy-looking efficiency.

A little more rust, a little more stench; pretty much the same!A man with immense shoulders and flowing gray locks sits at a table off to the side of the bar- your uncle Olaf.  You can barely contain your joy at seeing him after ten years, and by the tears welling in his eyes you can see that he's similarly affected."Well, young'un!  You've grown out of all proportion," he says, eyeing you up and down with avuncular approval.  "Grub must be good at that Academy.  But small talk can wait.  There's little time, and much to do."

They remind you of the scientists from the terraforming team.  As soon as one of them spots you they all look in your direction and make their way over."Are you <PN>, Captain of the <PSN>?" asks one of the women, and when you nod in confirmation they all grin.  "Allow me to introduce myself, I'm Sarah Tanner, and we're from the Nirvana Terraforming and Stellar Engineering company, I believe you have worked with our company before?"When you slowly nod your head, they beam proudly."We have a proposal for you," Sarah continues brightly.  "Would you be interested in re-terraforming New Ireland?"You look at them incredulously for a moment.                                        dHead to <RST> in the <RSY> system to meet with your Uncle Olaf.                                        îKeep dropping into the bar on the Earth's Kane Band in the Sol system to see if the Bureau needs your services.                                        ™Keep dropping into the bar on Merrol in the Aldebaran system to see if the Rebellion is prepared to increase your security clearance.                                        zTo get more work with the Polaris find the planet Mu'ar Haro and speak with Mu'Randa.                                        ûKeep dropping by the P'ar Aed bar in the P'aedt system to see if P'Jeena and his team have finished analyzing their data.                                        õKeep dropping by the Tre'ar Erma bar in the Tre'erman system to see if the meeting with the Wraith has been organized.                                        nHead back to Mu'ar Haro in the Mu'Hari system to see what Mu'Randa wants.

You heard from Uncle Olaf often enough during your years at the academy, but he would never tell you exactly what he was doing.  Now you know, and feel a swell of pride and affection for the big man before you.                                       ±Olaf turns to you as you enter the bar.  The last run has left you feeling a little drained; your clashes with Pirates have left you short on fuel and patience.  "Rough trip?"  Olaf says as he raises a quizzical eyebrow in your direction."I am sick to death of having to deal with these pirates," you say, waving for a drink.  "They are making life increasingly difficult for honest folk to make a living.  I'm going to have to kill a few people if this keeps up, but I have to admit that I don't mind saying that I'd kill off a hell of a lot more if I had the opportunity.  With the Federation Navy under the thumb of the Bureau, and the Bureau in league with these thugs, nothing will ever get done."You see a dark look cross Olaf's face, and you catch yourself wondering what could have left Olaf so bitter.  For as long as you have known him he has held a grudge against the Central Government.  You have always felt it was because Olaf is a fair man, and one who is not afraid to speak out to expose injustice.  In his lifetime he has seen many horrible episodes, including the death of your parents.  He has never spoken of it to you, but you know that the scars still run deep in his heart from the events of that day.His gaze returns to your eyes, and you get the impression that the time is coming near for him to unburden himself of the horror he has carried for too long."Listen," he whispers as he takes your hand in his.  "Back in the old days, Yer Father was feeling much the same way.  Cut-throats intercepted his shipments, and the Federation made legal trade almost impossible, with their export taxes, and their exorbitant charges for escorts and other protection.  The Federation bled the small companies dry with their tithes, while cultivating the old Leviathans and their rich hereditary owners.  They maintained their monopoly with their kickbacks."Seeing Unions and Associations had been outlawed, yer father decided to form a secret organization.  'The Association of Free Traders' was formed.  We shared information and risk by travelling in our own convoys with ships modified to carry armaments.  We built our own shipyard, out in the Galactic North where I was chief designer."It wasn't that we were criminals.  We just realized that the system wasn't fair for people like us, and that it was our duty to find ways to circumvent its holds.  As yer Father used to say, 'When injustice becomes law, then resistance becomes duty.'""So what happened?"  You ask.Olaf's expression darkens "McGowan."With that, your own expression darkens.  "That black hearted monster," you swear venomously."Yea, McGowan," he agrees angrily.  "Y'see, yer dad had became known as the "Pirate King" and life was good.  His ship 'Unrelenting' was one of the greatest ships I or anyone had ever built.  She was a heavily modified Carrier, with a better weapons platform and more powerful engines.  Slowly we began to lose more and more shipments to the Federation, and yer father sent McGowan to investigate why.  Your father had seen his smarts and put him on the Board of Advisers, the controlling body of the Association.  McGowan organized a meeting between yer father, the Board of Advisers and the other privateers who hadn't joined the Association.  He said that they had information vital to the Association's survival."So the 'Unrelenting' and the others exited hyperspace at the meeting place, a far off system inhabited by no bugger, only to find the mother of all Federation battle-fleets waiting for them."It was a trap, and McGowan had betrayed us all.  Yer father marshalled a fierce last stand, allowing most of the fleets to jump to safety, but was killed in the process along with yer mum and almost every friend I had ever known.  I was one of the few to make it off 'Unrelenting' alive, and I bought you with me."I vowed that they would be avenged, but I knew that I was not the man to do it.  My responsibility was to keep the promise I made to yer mother, to keep ye alive, so that ye may take yer place at the head of the Organization of free traders.  And so that ye could make the Federation pay for their corruption, and avenge your parents, by killing the black hearted McGowan."                                       ≥The story that Olaf has told you has made your blood boil."Where do I begin?" you ask, visions of the innocent people of New Ireland and your own family flitting through your mind fuelling your desire for revenge."Remember, the secret of having a strong organization is to have lots of members.  Even now, many old hands keep at their trades, slipping secret shipments of contraband through Federation Space.  The structure of the Association is still pretty much in place, less those who joined the rebels.  "The first thing ye have to do is convince 'em ye're trustworthy.  I's held as much together in these past years as I could.  I know I prob'ly should have told ye about it, but I didn't want to place ye under any pressure.  The past few runs have been very good, and the people I have kept in contact with are happy to sign on."You should go to <RST> in the <RSY> system and speak to Dace.  She was your father's bookkeeper in the old days, and she's minded things as best she could.  I'm afraid that some of yer father's money has gone to funding things for the Rebels, but I knew that was where yer father's allegiance would have been if he had have been alive.  However, there is still a large inheritance to be collected from Dace."Also let her know that the Association is back under way again, and to expect membership fees to be coming in soon.  Once ye have done all that, head back here to me."                                        √We have uncovered a piece of information suggesting that the Federation may be mounting a probe on our defenses soon - we would like you to go and learn more.                                       ÿMessage to:  <PN>Message from:  Mu'RandaWe have recently intercepted some radio traffic which suggests that the Federation may be looking into launching a raid on our defenses in an effort to gain some intelligence on our capabilities.

Head over to Moash and embarrass the Moash House by either killing their veteran warriors or forcing them to run away in fear.                                        öLead a raid on Moash in an effort to embarrass the Moashi by either destroying or driving off their veteran warriors.                                        FHead to <RST> to destroy McGowan.                                       ‚While you are quietly sipping your drink, wondering where you should go to find any 'anomalous' readings with the new Polaris technology in your cargo holds, you see the local news net air a story on the long-term effects of holo-emissions on developing tissue."Ha!" snorts one old salt a couple of tables over.  "You'd better remember to keep your children away from the Wolf 359 system then.  With all those old military types trying to keep tabs on the young fellahs running the show now, that place has more holo-emissions than even the pan-Federation games!"As the others at his table snicker at his comment, it gets you thinking.  Perhaps a look at the Wolf 359 system might be worthwhile...                                        áJust a quick reminder that you need to register to get any further storyline missions.Thank you.                                        ûAs soon as you land you feel the urge to head back to Merrol to try to obey the orders of Krane to infiltrate the rebels.                                       ¯As you almost absentmindedly go through your post-flight routine, you find yourself concentrating on observing the ebbs and flows of the universe when you sense a familiar presence approaching.  You turn around to see a grinning P'Jeena coming towards you."Ory'hara!  It is good to see you again," he says, happy in his bookish way.  "I've been trying to find you for some time now."You shake his hand and invite him to sit down, asking him what was so important he has been trying to chase you down."Well," he begins quietly, "we have been going over the sensor logs from your missions to the Rebels, and we have found something that we believe needs more attention.  I was wondering if you could help us out again?"                                       /"We noticed an odd-looking ship that appeared in the Koria system," P'Jeena explains in his quiet voice.  "You may remember it as being identified as a 'Krypt Pod'."Anyway, we've been trying to identify it ever since we learned about it," he continues thoughtfully.  "Unfortunately the only reference to Krypt we have found comes from some of our most ancient archives referring to a group of Vell-os that we dealt with when they rescued us from the Colonial Council nearly seven centuries ago."So we want you to go and see the Vell-os who is posted to the Kane University on Earth," P'Jeena concludes slowly, "I believe his name is Llyrell, and ask him if he can help us with our enquiries.  Once you have done that, meet me on P'ar Aed and we will talk further."You tell him that you would be glad to help him try to uncover the mystery, shake his hand and head back to your ship to begin preparing her for the long trip to Earth.  You cannot help but wonder if 'Llyrell' is the Vell-os who you met all that time ago in Sol...                                       ¿As soon as you sit down to enjoy a drink you a young courier comes up to you and hands you a message-pod before immediately heading off to his next delivery.  A little surprised you open it, and you see vision of your Uncle Olaf fill the small screen."Well young'un," he drawls quietly, "now that you're top dog, it was inevitable that somone would try to sneak around you.  Apparently one of McGowan's old lieutenants is trying to put together his old network.  I suggest you head over to the Scheall system to show him the error of his ways.  When you're done with him, why don't you drop by <RST> and we'll have a few drinks..."With that, the screen goes dead.                                        °Head to the Scheall system to destroy the upstart Guild-Master before heading to <RST> to have a few drinks with Uncle Olaf.                                        <PN> From: OlafAnother upstart has started trying to put together another network.  If you want to deal with him, head over to Scheall and if you like you can drop in on Viking for a drink or two afterwards.                                       ÀAs you walk around the spaceport you notice a few ordinary looking people giving you some startled looks.  Your unspoken questions are soon answered when you see a number of them converge on a couple of ship bays and you see a number of RAGE Gunboats lifting off the surface.  Clearly, you have stumbled on to a small Bureau cell.It's up to you if you want to follow them and destroy them or leave it to the authorities.                                        pDestroy the RAGE Gunboats that are transporting the traitorous Bureau cell.                                       The soldier who was your contact with Krane comes up to you as you wander the spaceport and hands over a datapad without a word.  On it is information regarding the recent activities of a conglomerate group of soldiers and warriors from the various cultures now dominated by the Bureau.  Apparently they have now started stretching their legs by sniping at Bureau interests and are based on <DST> in the <DSY> system.You nod and tell the soldier that you will take care of the problem."Just make sure you destroy them all and we'll provide you with the explosives to destroy their base before dropping back here for a quick debrief when you are finished," he nods, clapping you on the shoulder like an old friend and moving away.                                        ˜Head to <DST> in the <DSY> system to put down a minor uprising of a group of disaffected warriors and soldiers from various governments now dominated by the Bureau before returning to <RST> in the <RSY> system.                                        ëHead to <DST> in the <DSY> system to utterly destroy an uprising before heading back to <RST> for a debrief.                                        |Head to <RST> in the <RSY> system to finish the destruction of the Federation military.                                        vHead to <RST> in the <RSY> system to help the Auroran operation meet its goals...                                        óTravel to <RST> in the <RSY> system to pay your respects to the man who inspired the events of the past few weeks.                                        xHead to <RST> in the <RSY> system to begin the destruction of the Auroran military.                                        xHead to <RST> in the <RSY> system to finish the destruction of the Aurora military.                                        yHead to <RST> in the <RSY> system to help the Federation operation meet its goals...                                        úKeep checking by the bar on Rebel I to see if the Rebel code-breakers have managed to extract the information you need.                                        ñGo to Port Kane in the Kania system to pick up a counter-intel team and their prisoner before returning to Earth.                                       »As you look around the various vessels on offer you are tapped on the shoulder and turn around to see Rodney, the Sigma Shipyards representative."I have a mission of some urgency for you," he begins, quite seriously.  "It involves travelling across most of the known galaxy, picking up a cargo that isn't strictly legal, and returning here."Before you answer," he raises his hand to forestall your reply, "be aware that you may well come under intense fire in a place far from where we will be able to help you, but also be aware that if we cannot trust you to take this mission, we cannot trust you with any of our more sensitive corporate secrets."Are you up for it?"                                       ∂"Good," he relaxes, looking visibly relieved.  "The cargo we want you to pick up is <CQ> tons of <CT> from the planet <DST> in the <DSY> system, which is in the far Southeast of Auroran space.  The Aurorans won't be happy with you taking it to bring here, but that may be the least of your problems.  Recently, some sort of pirate group has blockaded the planet, and none of our ships have been able to get through."Now," he continues gravely, "once you have secured the <CT>, you need to return here without being scanned by the Aurorans.  If you do get scanned, you may as well dump your cargo and not bother returning here, as we will wash our hands of you.  At the end of the day, we have legitimate operations in Auroran space that we cannot do without, and we are not prepared to risk those over a single shipment of <CT>."Do you have any questions?" he asks, and you shake your head.  "Good luck then."                                        ´Pick up <CQ> tons of <CT> on the planet <DST> in the <DSY> system and take it back to <RST> in the <RSY> system without being scanned.                                       zAlmost as soon as you enter the shipyard you run into Rodney, the Sigma Shipyards representative."I'm glad you stopped by," he begins, very seriously.  "I have a mission of the utmost secrecy for you.  I can't really tell you any of the details, but if you do accept, it might be some time before you can return here."Are you up for it?"                                       •"You may or may not be aware," he explains after nodding at your acceptance, "that we have the capability to use the old hypergate network; the parts of it that work, that is."He leans forward conspiratorially."We have remained in contact with our former CEO, Donald Chick," he informs you in a near whisper, "and as we rotate the codes, we pass them on to him."You raise your eyebrows in surprise.  According to rumor, Donald Chick has become a part of the Rebellion against the Bureau.  No wonder Sigma Shipyards wants to keep this a secret."We need you to take him the new codes," he continues quietly, passing you an encrypted message pod.  "He is currently located on <RST> in the <RSY> system, north of Federation space.  To help you on the way we will upload them into your navigation computer, and you can update them any time you check into a Federation MissionBBS.  This means that you too will have access to the hypergate system..."He pauses as what he just said sinks in."While you are out there, avoid being scanned at all costs," he adds after a moment, "as we will wash our hands of you.  We cannot afford to have the Bureau start investigating our business dealings too closely."Finally," he concludes quickly, "when this is all over, you might want to lay low for a while.  I'm sure the Feds will be looking for you to explain your voyage into the galactic north.  Good luck."                                        àDeliver the new hypergate codes to Donald Chick on <RST> in the <RSY> system without being scanned.

The space {G"jock" "chick"} lifestyle is a fairly lonely one, with months between seeing old friends, and you are more than happy to chat away for a while with him.  It turns out that he is an Auroran living in Federation space.  When he told you, you looked at him somewhat skeptically, but once he explained that he was watched by the government very carefully, and had to log all his travel and movements, you can see that this might be possible.  Charengo has been living in Fed space since his House cast him out.  Your limited knowledge of the Auroran lifestyle gives you enough of an idea not to question him further; these things are always a matter of honor, and best left alone.During the course of the night it becomes apparent that Charengo is something of an entrepreneur, and has organized for a number of Federation citizens to go to Hourglass and hunt the dreaded Cunjo.  He has a number of expatriate Auroran warriors to act as guides, and enough weapons to destroy a small Federation battle group.  He has run a number of successful hunts, but has run into a snag.  His regular pilot was killed when a Cunjo ripped him to pieces.  So now he has a party ready to leave, but no one to get them there.Suddenly, a light comes to his eyes, and you can all but see a light bulb appear next to him.  "Say," he asks, "what are you doing tomorrow?  Do you feel up to ferrying us to Hourglass and dropping us off back at Earth?  It might be a little risky.  Lately, it seems the Cunjo population has increased, and a number of them have been mating at erratic times.  However, we have plenty of weapons, so if it gets too hairy, you'll be well covered by me and my team."You look at him in a mixture of disbelief.  You have never seen a Cunjo, but you really don't want to.Charengo sees your expression, smiles and leans closer, "There is big money in this.  If you do it for me, I'll always be in your debt.  And I'll pay you 75,000.  You won't have to go on surface for very long, and you won't even have to leave your ship.  Even in mating season, Cunjo can't tear through metal."What do you say?    th months between seeing oldf  €You stick out your hand, and Charengo grasps it."I really should be getting everything organized," he smiles warmly.  "I'll meet you at your ship tomorrow.  I'll have my team with me, and four clients, three of which are public servants who are out for a thrill, and one who is a much more serious hunter.  We'll probably stay on <RST> for a few days, depending on how the hunt goes, and then we'll return to Earth when we're finished."                                        ûTake Charengo, his team and his clients to Hourglass for a few days to hunt Cunjo, before returning to Earth for payment.                                       fCharengo has just spent an hour guiding you to a well used landing site.  All around there is dense forest, and the undergrowth is just starting to cover a huge number of deep craters.  You set down, and the sensors are going wild.  As soon as you do, Charengo and his team leap out of the hatch, brandishing their weapons with gusto.  Behind them come the clients, three looking like they should be wearing brown underpants, the fourth eyeing the undergrowth intently.  You cycle the hatch closed and watch.  A Cunjo suddenly breaks from the undergrowth, flying through the air to attack one of Charengo's men.  At least it would have, if a rocket hadn't plowed into its chest before detonating the beast into a rapidly expanding pink vapor cloud.  The public servants leap to the ground, pointing their weapons in every direction at once.Charengo lays about with a continuous laser, and in the space of a few minutes the clearing you landed in is three times the size.  His men set up the mines and sentry lasers, and the camp takes shape.You decide that you might try this game for yourself, seeing as you are here.  You check your blaster, and hail Charengo to tell him you are coming down for a look.No sooner have you stepped outside the hatch than the surrounding forest comes alive with the sounds of Cunjos calling to each other."Look out!" Charengo yells.  "The Cunjo are going to rush through here!  Seems like our safe landing site has become a mating ground!"You haul your blaster from its holster, trying to look everywhere at once.  The underbrush erupts, and around 10 Cunjo burst from the foliage.  You leap to the side, snapping off blaster bolts at the first Cunjo you see.  It moves faster than you have ever seen anything move, but enough of your fire hits it to put it down.  A sudden premonition of doom sweeps through you, and you spin to see a Cunjo scant feet from you.  It pounces forward, stabbing its long claws into your arms.  You gasp in pain as its claws bite deep, and the Cunjo roars into your face.  It's fetid breath makes your head swim, but you manage to keep your wits about you enough to raise your blaster and blow its head off.  You collapse, and through a deepening haze see Charengo run towards you, blasting from the hip.  Then, blackness...You stay on Hourglass for four days, recovering enough from your wounds to pilot the ship back.  Charengo is glad to take off as soon as you are able.  Apparently this trip was hotter than was originally expected.  The public servants never fired their weapons, but still had some 'very manly' holoshots taken with killed Cunjos.  The fourth client made some kills on his own, but they all looked on in disbelief when Charengo and the guides explained that in the Auroran Empire, warriors hunt Cunjo with hand to hand weapons.  All too soon, you have packed up and are heading home.                                       7Just as you sit down you see a group made up of one man and two women, all with the soft, pallid look of scientists walk into the bar.  They remind you of the scientists from the terraforming team.  As soon as one of them spots you they all look in your direction and make their way over."Are you <PN>, Captain of the <PSN>?" asks one of the women, and when you nod in confirmation they all grin.  "Allow me to introduce myself, I'm Sarah Tanner, and we're from the Nirvana Terraforming and Stellar Engineering company, I believe you have worked with our company before?"When you slowly nod your head, they beam proudly."We have a proposal for you," Sarah continues brightly.  "Would you be interested in re-terraforming New Ireland?"You look at them incredulously for a moment.                                       *As soon as you board you are met by a large, savagely tattooed man who quickly disables you."You now have the eternal enmity of the Wild Geese," he informs you quietly before departing to begin repairs to his ship, leaving you incapacitated for several hours.

Good luck.\"" "Okay,\" Geoff continues, \"a little background so you know what you are getting yourself in for.\"Firstly,\" he begins earnestly, \"the Aurora system is several jumps south of the Tichel system.\"The Empire itself is more like a loose confederacy of five major houses,\" he explains, \"than a true Empire.  It is ruled over by a Ruling Council made up of three representatives from each house and the Emperor, who comes from the 'first house', and he or she has the only veto vote.\"The first family changes from time to time,\" he continues dryly, \"and the current first house is the Moash house who have demonstrated that they are capable of underhanded dealings.\"However,\" he says, grinning, \"just because Moash is the first house doesn't mean that they are immune from attacks by the other houses.  In fact far from it, the Moash house is probably attacked more often than any other house.
