'We serve a higher order than ourselves.9If we die serving Aurora, then we have died as we should.QDuty, Courage, Honor, Integrity and Impeccability.  These are what we believe in.EWe were born poor and weak.  We have survived, and we are now strong.BOur lives only have meaning if we spend them defending the Empire.HWe have few friends and many enemies, but we will strive on nonetheless.sUntil death we will spend all our effort in protecting our civilisation, and beyond death we will strive as we can.iBeware the Federation.  At their best they are deceptive.  At their worst they are downright treacherous.IWe fight any and all who wish to bring harm to the leaders of the Empire.0Today, like any other day, is a good day to die.

8We are the Aurorans.  We fight only for glory and honor.CMay our actions bring honor to ourselves, our House and our Empire.5What is it you want?

We strive to attain impeccability, and we will wrestle with it until we die.JDo not stray from the warriors path, for that way lies shame and dishonor.AThe Federation is without honor, and we fight only to cleanse it.bWe watch everyone we come across to measure them against ourselves to see if they are worthy foes.%We are watching you closely, Captain.

After stowing their charge in your cargo bay the leader of the team comes forward and in a polite tone tells you that they are ready to go any time you are.The dockworkers load your cargo in a highly organized and quick manner under the watchful eyes of a few Federation military observers.As soon as you land you see a team of three uniformed men and one woman leading a bedraggled and apathetic female prisoner.  As she draws closer you begin to doubt whether this broken woman would have ever been capable of summoning the courage to try to hack her way into a protected system.  You shrug, bemused.After stowing their charge in your cargo bay the leader of the team comes forward and in a polite tone tells you that they are ready to go any time you are.bAs soon as you land you see a team of two uniformed men and two women leading a bedraggled and apathetic male prisoner.  As they draw closer you notice the prisoner's hard callused hands.  You start wondering about how a supposed financial whiz managed to get the hardened hands of a physical laborer.  You feel a couple of suspicions starting to surface in the back of your mind as you head back into your cockpit.After stowing their charge in your cargo bay the leader of the team comes forward and in a polite tone tells you that they are ready to go any time you are.You barely recognize the hunched, sad-looking figure as the Faran Kurik from the news vids.  As the counter-intel team brings him past you he looks at you out of the depths of his misery."I hope you're proud of yourself," he mumbles.  You shrug.While you remain unsure about the morality of the tactics used by the Bureau in this 'spy war,' you are worldly enough to know that in war no one is innocent, and sometimes certain actions which would normally be abhorrent are necessary.  You are also beginning to realize that Krane is deliberately assigning these missions to you, and possibly even lying about their very nature to see how far you are willing to go.  So far you are unsure as to whether or not this is your thing, but you get the feeling from the way the missions have been ramping up that you will have to make your decision soon.After stowing Mr. Kurik in your cargo bay the leader of the team comes forward and in a respectful voice tells you that they are ready to go any time you are.As soon as you land you go through your post-flight routine followed quickly by your pre-flight routine to get you ship ready for take-off again.  You don't have much desire to sit around here and wait for the Bureau's goons to find you.  As soon as possible you decide to head back to <RST> in the <RSY> system to let Mr. Chick know that his design seems to be working.3As you step off your ship you see the {G"stunning" "disgustingly attractive"} figure of Commander Krane waiting for you."You took your time <PN>," she begins in her beautiful voice.  "Tell me what's been happening."You make your report and she is very interested to hear about the appearance of General Smart and that you are now rescuing agents.  She asks you to expand on a few points and after another ten minutes or so of grilling you she relaxes, satisfied."Good work," she congratulates with a pretty smile, "you have done well!  Now we must start using your position to best advantage."From here on in," she states, "I want you to bring any rebels you pick up here and we will do a quick body switch, so that we can start planting a few agents in amongst their network.  Hopefully they will start getting you to place agents in future, and then we will be really getting somewhere."In the mean time," she continues meaningfully, "I want you to deliver this message pod to my man on Earth, you know who he is.  Good luck!"You are taken into a darkened room by a dockworker who refuses to be drawn."Hello my pretty," comes that horrifically beautiful voice.  "Report."You make your report and she grills you about the extraction and the appearance of General Smart.  Your conditioning means that you cannot resist her questioning.  Not that you would with that small lump of explosive just behind your ear."Good!" the voice decides finally, "you have done well!.  Now we must start using your position to best advantage."From here on," she commands, "I want you to bring any rebels you pick up here and we will do a quick body switch, so that we can start planting a few agents in amongst their network.  Hopefully they will start getting you to place agents in future, and then we will be really getting somewhere."In the mean time," she continues meaningfully, "I want you to deliver this message pod to my man on Earth, you know who he is.  Don't think for a moment that my finger has left your switch."You land and go through your normal post-flight checklist as normal.  When you are finished you head outside to stretch your legs and await the arrival of your passenger.Within five minutes he arrives and you bring him on board giving him the regulation five minute tour.  Then you head back up to your cockpit to begin preparing to take him off to <RST> in the <RSY> so that Commander Krane can start to organize the infiltration of the Rebel network.This planet is a little different from the average Auroran planet you hear about in the Federation.  Yes it is polluted, and yes there are an enormous number of poor people being oppressed by the warrior class, but the gaudiness, intricacy and sheer amount of adornment of the arcologies on this world surprises you.  You guess that the Moash House, who seem to be running this place, are fairly well off financially.You also notice that there are an enormous number of the infamous Auroran warriors, wearing their colorfully savage tattoos, wandering about, many of them giving you menacing looks.  In the few hours you spend wandering the arcology, you estimate that you have seen several thousand warriors doing little or nothing.  This Moash House must have a fair sized military if it can afford to have so many warriors just sitting around.After several hours of exploring the arcology you decide that it is time to start your journey back to <RST> to make your report to Krane.From inside your cockpit you get almost continuous readings on the enormous amount of damage being done by the Federation soldiers all over the station.  You estimate that in a few hours this station will be virtually depopulated and practically uninhabitable.Despite the enormous number of men committed to this mission, you get the feeling that this mission is more for show than anything else.  Your best guess is that this is a diversion for a much larger main push elsewhere.  Not that this mission is proceeding all your way; from your comm you keep getting reports of Moash resistance and by the sound of it the disorganized pockets of Moash warriors are acquitting themselves admirably.Despite this, they are overwhelmed by sheer numbers and by the overwhelming levels of firepower brought to bear upon them.  A little over four hours after landing you see the short blond hair and tall broad figure of General Sutton coming aboard."That's it for us," he informs you casually.  "We're finished here."You are greeted by two rather famous figures.  You recognize the two men as being Mr Donald Chick, the former CEO of Sigma Shipyards, and General Cade 'Sundown' Smart, who was a former Head of the Federation Armed Forces."We wanted to thank you for your efforts on such short notice," says Mr Chick by way of greeting.  "We are a little thin on the ground just at the moment, and your arrival has allowed us to carry out this operation without stretching our resources any further than they already are.""We want you to take the encrypted message pod to <RST> in the <RSY> system," General Smart informs you, indicating the message pod being loaded onto your ship by a Rebel soldier.  "You will be met there by a man named Dorraj Rainsford who will take the pod off you and tell you how to get the reply, if any is forthcoming.  As soon as you have the reply return here.""And thanks again for your help," says Mr Chick before they both take their leave.As soon as you land you see Federation soldiers killing and ransacking everything in sight.  They approach their job with an air of savage efficiency that impresses you no end.  You begin to see why Federation soldiers are not much liked by the Aurorans.After wandering around observing them at work for little over an hour you are approached by their commander, Captain Allen Wilson."We have found some intel on the whereabouts of the rebel headquarters," he informs you, wiping the sweat off his brow.  "We will be finished here in a few more hours and then we will be passing that information on to the other naval forces in the area while we escort you back."Here is a data crystal containing the location of the base in question," he explains tiredly.  "If you could pass it on to your superior as soon as possible, so that the Bureau gets the information as quickly as possible."You nod, and make your way back to your ship to start your long flight back to <RST>.Using the various passes given to you by Krane you easily penetrate the heavy security surrounding the Federation President.  In a few short minutes you find yourself entering his room."You!" he exclaims in surprised recognition.  "What are you doing here?  And how did you get in?"You smile a small malicious smile, and watch his face go pale."Y... You're with the Bureau aren't you," he grinds out fearfully and you nod.  He suddenly looks very deflated and old.  To save him the trouble of asking, you quickly outline what the Bureau wants of him, and inform him of the consequences if he fails in his new duties."I will do what you ask," he whispers with tears in his eyes when you finish.  "What other choice do I have?"You shrug and walk out.  You quickly dash through a surveillance barrier and watch on in amusement as the President tries to inform his security chief of your intrusion.  You chuckle when he is told that any intrusion is impossible because the system was "designed by the Bureau".Given the efficient manner of the Polaris, you are not terribly surprised when Bis Andreya, along with her eight bodyguards, greets you when you open your hatch.  After exchanging a few courtesies, you formally ask her to come aboard, and she does so.Her bodyguards take charge and whisk her onto your ship and they inform you that they will make sure that she is taken care of.  You shrug your shoulders and head back up to your cockpit to begin going through your pre-flight checklist.When you land you see four of the Auroran Cruisers deploying ground troops to protect a fifth Cruiser which is deploying a bulky piece of equipment, which you assume will be the beacon which the rest of the Auroran fleet will home-in upon.  You can see that the Auroran warriors on the ground immediately start taking casualties from the Polaris warriors, while the remaining Cruisers try to keep the air above the deploying beacon clear of Polaris ships.Of course, the Polaris will destroy the beacon as soon as you leave, but it only has to send out a single pulse to allow the Auroran fleet to pinpoint its exact location.Soon enough, the beacon is fully deployed, and the Aurorans begin falling back to their ships.  As they begin retreating you can see that several groups hold themselves as a suicide rearguard so that their colleagues can escape.  To a man they are killed, but their sacrifice allows the Aurorans to get away cleanly.|You land and with shaking hands you go through your normal post-flight checklist knowing that you have no choice but to condemn the brave man you are about to meet.  When you are finally finished you take a deep breath and head outside to await the arrival of your passenger.Within five minutes he arrives and you bring him on board, only staying with him long enough to make sure he is settled.  Then you head back up to your cockpit with only a horrible feeling of self-loathing you begin preparing to take him off to <RST> in the <RSY> so he can be taken apart by the Bureau just like you were.As soon as you land you go looking for this Burton guy.  Surprisingly he's not too hard to find.  The <DST> marketplace is very well organized, and within a half-hour, you're standing in front of the man you want, haggling over the price.The two of you quickly reach an agreement, and you get your <CQ> tons of <CT> no questions asked.  He even gets one of his men to give you a hand loading the stuff onto your ship.After a casual look around to ensure that none of the Federation authorities are paying you any obvious attention, you run through a quick pre-flight checklist before heading off-planet.You go over to the now-familiar Burton marquee and get down to business.  Like last time, he strikes a fair deal and speeds you on your way with your <CQ> tons of <CT> for the Rebellion.As soon as you land you go looking for this Arpad guy.  He is a lot harder to find than Burton was on Las Vegas, as the <DST> marketplace is not nearly as well organized.  However, after just over an hour of searching, you're standing in front of the man you want, haggling over the price.The two of you quickly reach an agreement, and you get your <CQ> tons of <CT> no questions asked.  He even gets a couple of his men to give you a hand loading the stuff onto your ship.After a casual look around to ensure that none of the Federation authorities are paying you any obvious attention, you run through a quick pre-flight checklist before heading off-planet.You quickly make your way through the disorganized <DST> markets to find Arpad's office and get down to the business of getting your supplies.  After haggling with him you almost feel cheated as you are sure that he somehow tricked you into parting with more than necessary for what you are getting.  But once the deal is made he gets two of his men to help load up your beloved <PSN>.  Then you head off on your way with your <CQ> tons of <CT> for the Rebellion.SYou land and go through your normal post-flight checklist as usual.  When you are finished you head outside to stretch your legs and await the arrival of this passenger.You do not have to wait long; within ten minutes a plump looking middle-aged matron walks up and introduces herself as Anna.  The ability of the Rebels to spread information through the galaxy must be very good if she was able to be here almost as you landed.You take her inside and show her around before heading back up to your cockpit to begin preparing to head back out into space.You land and go through your normal post-flight checklist as usual.  When you are finished you head outside to stretch your legs and await the arrival of your passenger.Within five minutes he arrives and you bring him on board giving him the regulation five minute tour.  Then you head back up to your cockpit to begin preparing to pilot back out into space.As soon as you land you are whisked away to a hospital.  Some sort of breathing apparatus placed over your face and everything goes black.For the next few days you float in and out of consciousness, never truly awakening.  One time you recognize the voice of General Smart."...things they do," he growls angrily, "and you still want to play your damn spy games?""Always was like Melissa to use a club instead of a knife," replies another voice impassively, "she never did have much finesse, and look where..."Any further talk was cut off as you slipped further into the darkness.You awake sometime later to see General Smart sitting at your bedside."Good to see you're awake," he greets you.  "I wanted to be here to tell you that I no longer have any doubts about you.  I doubt that I would've had the strength to do what you did, very few would.  I would be honored to work with you in the future."Now get back to Merrol.  Tell Jay to stop pestering me about you."After your long journey you are only too happy to be landing, even if it is on a strange world.  You are looking forward to stretching your legs if nothing else.You open your hatch to see a black-robed young woman standing at the end of your ramp."Greetings Ory-Hara," she greets you, "I am Mu'Randa of the Mu'Hari.  I have been chosen as a representative of our Ruling Council to meet with your leaders."Your confusion lasts only a moment until you realize that obviously the Polaris contacted the Rebellion about arranging a meeting.  You quickly explain that your leaders will be unprepared to greet her as they were uncertain as to the nature of this mission."Of course," she says.  "That was our intention.  We have no wish to the see the Rebellion as you would wish it to be seen, we want to see it in its everyday mode.  How else are we to make a decision about supporting it?"You sigh and get ready for a long trip back.Mu'Randa heads out and greets a elderly looking green-robed man in the musical Polaris tongue.  They exchange a few pleasantries before Mu'Randa turns to you."May I present Ver'Tanin," she says, "the leader of the Ver'ash, what we call our engineer and healer caste."He bows, and you bow deeply in response saying that you have been overwhelmed by not only the technology of the Polaris, but also their kindness and generosity.  He beams and bows deeply.  He responds with a few words and Mu'Randa tells you that he is impressed with your courtly manners and that he is happy to learn that not all outsiders are barbarians.  He then glances towards a group of similarly garbed men and they begin loading your cargo before bowing again and leaving you alone with Mu'Randa."Well done!" she praises freely.  "I doubt that he could have been handled better."I believe that this is goodbye," she continues, "for now anyway.  I have my duties here and you must return to the Rebellion.  I'm glad that we were able to help you, despite the potential difficulties we might face because of it.  I'm glad to have met you, Ory-Hara."As soon as you land on New England you head out to stretch your legs.  After spending so long in space you need to work out a few kinks.You come back after a short walk and you decide to check on the readouts from the holo-scanner.  You are slightly amused to see it lit up like a Christmas tree with readouts spewing forth various data at an enormous rate.You wonder aloud in a slightly sarcastic voice if the techies would consider this to be anomalous.  You decide that it is strange enough for you.  You were getting sick of this aimless wandering around Federation space anyway.  Time to head back to <RST>.As you land you wonder what so many ships are doing in the system.  And seeing the level of activity on the station only arouses your curiosity further.  They are obviously preparing for something, but what?Eventually you come to a slightly less busy part of the station where you can access an info terminal without being too worried about someone looking over your shoulder.  You search for over an hour before you find an order from Admiral Raczak to the Chief Supply Officer telling him to have the war stocks increased to a level of three months.Three months!  Nobody stockpiles three months worth of stocks unless they are preparing to begin operating without the chance of regular resupply for a while.  And the only time Federation forces would do that would be if they were operating in enemy territory.You suddenly realize that you had better get back to <RST> to let them know about the planned invasion into Auroran space, and soon by the look of the level of readiness already achieved.hYou are greeted by {b818 "a smiling Flannigan.  After several moments of catching up you explain to him" "a heavily muscled man with the savage tattoos of an Auroran warrior.  He has some kind of stylized bird on his face that fascinates you in particular.  He introduces himself as Eamon Flannigan.\"I know you by reputation, 'Ory-Hara',\" he states with a lilting accent.  \"And if my speculations are correct you represent a certain group of people who intensely dislike the actions of a certain bureau and they want to know what I want in return for lending military aid.\"You nod, explaining"} the situation in detail while he listens carefully."Raczak's involved, eh?" he says thoughtfully.  "For that piece of information you can tell your superiors that I'll do it for free.  It probably won't take you long as I believe that you know that man over there already."He points out Geoff Daniels sitting nearby who comes over smiling."I think we've found out what we needed to," he says grinning at your confused expression.  "Let's get out of here before he changes his mind."You land wondering what so many Federation ships are doing in this system.  You cease wondering when you see the ten savagely tattooed warriors arrayed outside your ship wielding various brutal-looking blade weapons.You waste no time drawing your blaster and begin calmly shooting them dead one by one as they charge.  From ten meters away, the last one falls at your feet with a smoking hole where his left eye used to be.  The warriors looking on grin and salute your shooting prowess and bravery in standing against the charge.You shake your head and start looking around for clues as to what is going on.  It's not long before you run into a group of what appears to be Bureau negotiators talking to a Moash warrior.  Listening, you overhear detailed information concerning the Bureau plan wherein Raczak's men are going to be destroyed in a PR exercise to start a war involving both the Federation and the Auroran Empire.You decide it is time to get back to <RST> to pass this on to Geoff.You are surprised to see a smiling Mu'Randa when you open your hatch."Hello again Ory-hara," she says happy to see you.  "You have become something of legend amongst our people since we last met.  You have really lived up to your code-name, much as I thought you might.  And before you ask, yes I am a telepath.  I'm sorry I didn't tell you last time, but I thought that it might be detrimental to our working relationship."You wave your hand and tell her that it does not matter.  She smiles and goes on to introduce you to her fellow telepaths who you notice are all garbed in gray, much like she is garbed in black.  One of them notices you looking and tells you that the different castes wear differing clothes.  The Mu'Hari, the caste to which Mu'Randa belongs, wear all black.  The rest of the group belong to the Nil'kemorya and are all warriors.  Mu'Randa explains that the Ruling Council suggested that warrior telepaths might be more capable of dealing with difficult situations should they arise.As soon as you open your hatch the remaining rebel leaders start coming aboard.  You notice that Frandall is missing and you ask them about his absence."He's disappeared," replies Mr. Donald Chick with a shrug.  "We've learned from long experience that when he does this, he'll make contact in his own time, and there is nothing we can do to speed up that process."You roll your eyes and shake your head before giving your guests a quick tour of your ship, showing them their quarters for the trip.  They are all seasoned travelers and before long you are back at the controls of your beloved <PSN> prepping her for the long return journey.After your long journey you are only too happy to be landing, even if it is on a strange world.  You are looking forward to stretching your legs if nothing else.All thoughts of rest are dashed when you open your hatch and are surprised to see the familiar face of Mu'Randa waiting for you at the end of your ramp."Greetings 'Ory-Hara'," she grins as she greets you, "I have been chosen as a representative of our Ruling Council to meet with the leaders of your Rebellion."Your confusion lasts only a moment until you realize that obviously the Polaris contacted the Rebellion about arranging a meeting.  You quickly explain that your leaders will be unprepared to greet her as they were uncertain as to the nature of this mission."Of course," she says.  "That was our intention.  We have no wish to the see the Rebellion as you would wish it to be seen, we want to see it in its everyday mode.  How else are we to make a decision about supporting it?"You sigh and get ready for a long trip back.You are a more than a little surprised to have landed without a hitch.  You guess that the intelligence gathering capabilities of the Rebellion must be very capable for them to be able to almost casually infiltrate areas of incredibly high security with no trouble at all.After quickly going through your post-flight routine you step out and begin looking for a terminal to hook your datapad into.  After a brief search you find one and as casually as you can you hook your datapad up to it.After a few minutes of downloading and searching, the datapad display indicates that the required information has been retrieved and you unhook the 'pad and make your way back to the ship.As you go through your pre-flight routine you cannot help wondering just how sensitive Federation scanners are, and whether they can pick up the fact that you have contraband electronic cargo...	In the early hours of the morning you quickly make your way to the R&D area of the station.  You expect the Federation Security Forces to descend on you at any minute, but the Techs have done an amazing job at forging your pass-card and identification and so far you have been cleared through each checkpoint with a cursory glance.Before long you reach the Project Worldeater research offices.  In the lock, the Multi-key pass bursts into life, buzzing quickly through the various possible codes at a furious rate.  The door soon slides open.You are shortly in the main lab and examining the arrays before you.  Each one is in a different stage of completion.  Grabbing the one closest to complete, you then find the jamming device closest to the schematic you memorized.You conceal both in the satchel that the Heraan Techs gave you.  It is a shroud bag, designed to allow the true contents of a bag to be concealed under sensor scan, instead displaying innocuous items.  This is the first field trial, and you pray that it works.  You copy the researchers' files to Quantum Solid Crystal, and head for the door.  The trip back to your ship is stressful, but ultimately uneventful, and for once it seems, everything has gone off without a hitch.The captive Vell-os look as if they have seen better days.  They are gaunt and haggard, and many of them bear signs of the barbarous 'experiments' carried out by the Federation Scientists.  The look of appreciation on their faces brings a tear to the eye of the most hardened of your warriors, and they quickly line up to be drugged unconscious.  You ask Ivo why this is necessary, and he explains that the Federation would be able to track the Vell-os through their collective if they were conscious.As your warriors carry the Vell-os back aboard <PSN>, your sensor operator turns to you, a wild gleam in his eye.  You immediately recognize the look as the Fjargen, the wild fearful frenzied look of coming battle."Arbiter," he grins ruefully "A large Federation interceptor fleet has just entered the system and is moving in to block our escape."You call for battle stations, and the crew quickly rush to their positions.  Casting your eye out to the main viewport, you curse roundly.  The Federation are trying their utmost to stop you, and you are greatly outnumbered.  You will give them that; at least they make a good fight.  The battle lust fills your veins, and you bark out the order to attack...The Vell-os greets you when you land."You know that I must resist as strongly as I can," he tells you almost formally.  You nod, and you begin circling each other.In the following minutes the two of you attack each other in every way you can.  Both of you weave ever more complex flows, and both of you dance across around and through each others' weavings.  You quickly realize that he is following a pattern similar to that of the 'fatal convergence' of the Polaris, except that it only requires one warrior.  You cast about for a solution as the moment of truth draws closer.  Then you realize that you cannot defeat him using either your weaves or your dancing.As he executes his final attack, in desperation you abandon all your dances and weaves and you strike with the sudden stillness, taking him off guard."Ory'hara," he murmurs as he loses consciousness.  You quickly sedate him to keep him that way and drag him into your ship away from the many spectators who had gathered to watch the fight.You are greeted by {b818 "a smiling Flannigan.  After several moments of catching up you explain to him" "a heavily muscled man with the savage tattoos of an Auroran warriors.  He has some kind of stylized bird on his face that fascinates you in particular.  He introduces himself as Eamon Flannigan.\"I have heard a little about you already 'Ory-Hara',\" he states with a lilting accent, \"most of it good.  What can I do for you?\"He listens without comment as you explain"} the situation and your mission.  After making your case you ask him what he wants in return for the services of {b818 "the Geese" "his men"}."I want to go to the aid of Admiral Raczak when we finish on <RST>," he tells you in no uncertain terms.  You are a little surprised but agree to his terms.  You were expecting a demand for money, not a demand to perform another act of compassion."I will need an hour to assemble my men," he tells you.  "Then we can go."He leaves you wondering why he wants to rescue Raczak so badly.You step out expecting to be see several waiting warriors.  You are greeted by only one, but by the enormous number of battle tattoos he wears, you guess that he is more than just your average warrior.  You particularly notice the stylized bird he has tattooed on his face.He introduces himself as Techerakh, Thurokiir of the Heraan House.  You're not sure what that title means but you bow deeply.He formally asks of you what you came here for.  You reply that it was to warn of the two-pronged invasion which has obviously already started.  He looks surprised and asks you which two attacks you mean.  You tell him that both the Federation and the Moash House plan to invade.  He grills you for more detail and you tell him everything you know.You ask what you can do to help and he answers cynically that the only thing you can do would be to lead a fleet into Moash space to force them to return home.  You bow and tell him that you will pass that message on.You feel him eyeing you curiously as you leave.A group of huge men hastily load the crates on board your ship.  The cargo is unmarked, and you wonder exactly what it is you're transporting.pSame silent, efficient loading crew.  Are they simply dedicated, or driven?OThe now familiar men load your cargo.  Once inside your ship, they remove the simple dockworker garb that made their disguise, and stand before you in the cloth of Auroran warriors.  Bazara cuts an impressive figure in his armor, decorated with many small frescoes of battles, recent and long past.[As you walk down the ramp to continue your search, you see a group of Federation ground troops patrolling nearby, obviously searching for something or someone.  Becoming instantly alert, you eye them warily, and you are surprised when an old beggar approaches from behind you."Spare a few credits, kind {G "master" "mistress"}, for a hungry beggar?"  He looks somehow familiar, but beggars such as he are not uncommon sights along the Federation's northern borders.  You've started reaching for your credits when the beggar whispers "And a bunk on your vessel to get me back home?"You are stunned to discover that the 'beggar' is Bazara.  His disguise is perfect, even down to the smell of rank clothing and bad wine.  Bazara slips past you and hobbles up the ramp of your ship.  You smile to yourself, and follow him.In a dingy alleyway in a distant spaceport, you enter a bar to listen to yet more rumor and hearsay.  Unexpectedly, you glimpse Bariod, the Dominance dockmaster, talking animatedly to a group of men.  As you approach, smiling widely, one of the men turns and beneath the swirl of his cape you notice the emblem of House Moash!You shake Bariod's hand warmly, while your mind races.  The Heron Style has changed your view of combat - by ships, fists, and wits.  You realize now that Bariod is the traitor.  You have been lucky to catch him at his game.  You also know that Bariod will betray you as quickly as he betrayed House Heraan, so you must lull the man with guile and cunning.You gesture to his companions and ask him to introduce you.  "I'm always happy to meet fellow warriors."Bariod hesitates but introduces you to the four men who are with him.  You keep smiling and lock their names into your memory, and ask what it is they were discussing, exchanging hearty handshakes with them.  You see confusion in his eyes.  He must be wondering whether or not you know of his treachery.  To survive, you must keep him confused.Bariod says, "These men are undercover agents for House Heraan who have recently stolen the prototype of a new Federation assault weapon of incredible power.  They were about to show it to me when we saw you approaching."Bariod's blundering excuse tells you a number of things.  He's not a master spy at all, which means he has only recently turned against House Heraan.  Also, by openly mentioning that the men were undercover agents, he showed that he had little knowledge of such things.  Bariod, it seems, is a fool and his capture will be relatively easy - once you dispose of the Moashi.You accompany the four men toward their ship, ostensibly to 'view the prototype'.  As you walk, you distract Bariod with talk of matters in Dominance, carefully avoiding anything of importance.  Bariod may have sold out, but he might not have given away all his secrets yet.  When the Moashi ship is in sight, you summon all your strength, and leap at Bariod.  You snap your feet into his head, knocking him unconscious.  While performing this attack, you pull out a pistol and fire over your shoulder into the Moashi leader's head.  You feel blood and brains wash over your back.  You hit the deck rolling, as two shots from the man behind you whistle over you.  Continuing the roll, you piston upwards at the last possible second and smash your head under the chin of an assailant, snapping his neck with an audible crack.  Pain flashes in your side as a knife from the man beside you cuts through your tunic and slices across your ribs.  You grab his knife arm and pull his shoulder into the barrel of your pistol.  His shoulder and half of his upper back mist out behind him as you pull the trigger.  Shock kills him before he even hits the ground.  Spinning, you narrowly avoid being decapitated by the remaining Moashi dog, whose sword passes across your cheek and lodges in your shoulder.  Twisting, you wrench it from his grasp, catch it in mid-air, and stab it neatly into his mouth, which is conveniently opened in surprise at the speed of your movements.  Blood pumps from his shattered face as you let the sword go, allowing him to collapse on the floor.  After this, the task of dragging Bariod to your ship seems to take forever, especially seeing as the local guards are out looking for you.  While it would be easy to establish your credentials, it would take time, time which the Council didn't give you.After fighting your way through the heavier than expected pirate presence, you manage to touch down near the settlement camp to see many men and women, obviously with little martial experience, trying to hold out these treacherous dogs from their ramshackle homes.As soon as you and Hune enter the fray the battle turns.  You both hit them with everything you have and the honorless dogs quickly give ground, and not one survives to reach the relative safety of space."Thank you sirs," says the grateful leader of the colonists.  "We thought that we were just about to die.""At least you chose to go down fighting," grunts Hune gruffly, obviously uncomfortable with the praise, and you grin at his discomfort."But we would ask of you one favor," continues the settlement leader with some trepidation, "all our spacecraft have been destroyed by the Houseless pirates, and we need to pay our sponsors back on Dani by passing on some of the palladium we have managed to acquire.  Could you help us?"You are about to snap that you are not merchants to be carrying around produce, but Hune places a restraining hand on your arms as the man shrinks from your obvious rage."Of course we will," he intones quietly.  "True warriors are tasked to protect all the citizens of the Empire from all dangers, be they combat or mercantile based."You have the grace to look ashamed and you immediately head back to your ship to begin loading.2When you land you see a elderly looking brown-cloaked lady with gray hair hurry up your ramp and onto your ship.  Two gray-cloaked men who were flanking her stand at the bottom of the ramp as if guarding it."Bis Andreya!" exclaims Mu'Randa almost reverentially, which causes you to look at her suspiciously.  "What has happened?""I won't speak in front of a stranger," the old lady says with quiet force, "it is too much of a risk."At that moment you see a number of Federation soldiers begin entering the spaceport running towards your ship, and the two men in gray snap into action.  Within seconds they decimate the Federation forces in the most stunning display of martial arts you have ever seen.  Moments later they are running back up the ramp and entering your ship."Young {G "man" "lady"}, I suggest that we get out of here now!" suggests Bis Andreya gently.  "Make for <RST> in the <RSY> system."You decide it would be best to do just that as you have no wish to end up like those soldiers at the bottom of your ramp.You are greeted by several armed guards when you land, and a vaguely familiar man wearing a general's uniform."I am General Cade Smart," he introduces himself.  "We have scanned your vessel repeatedly, and I believe that at least some of your technology is Polaris in origin?"You nod, careful not to move overly much, as the soldiers with their weapons trained on you look ready to fire at even the smallest untoward twitch."If you are a friend of the Polaris then we have no argument with you," he continues quietly, "but I must ask you to leave.  This station is an outpost of the Rebellion against the Bureau of Internal Investigation, and although we have no desire to start any other conflict, we must maintain our security.  I apologize for treating you in this way, but I'm afraid that if we are to succeed in our war with the Bureau, we have little choice."You are bundled back onboard your ship and left alone.  It does not take much deduction to realize that the Polaris will want to hear about this.After going through your post-flight routine you head out of your ship to meet this Mu'Yana.  You start to worry when 20 minutes pass and she fails to show.  After an hour you are about to try calling the port authorities to see if they can locate her when a short, slim woman with messy blond hair walks up dragging a bag full of what appears to be clothes."Hi!" she smiles in greeting.  "I'm Mu'Yana.  Sorry I am late, but a Ver'ash asked me to help him out with an experiment, and it took a bit longer than he anticipated."You are about to tell her that she should have told the Ver'ash that she was required elsewhere, but then you remember that no Mu'hari can refuse to help if asked.  So, although she was probably agonizing over it, her social conditioning as a Mu'hari probably prevented her from saying any such thing.Instead you just smile and wave it away, telling her that it does not matter.  After helping her onboard, you head back up to the cockpit to start prepping your ship for a long flight.As soon as you open up your hatch, you are greeted by an intense-looking gentleman with inky-black hair and incisive ice-gray eyes.  He steps forward and shakes your hand."I have heard a lot about you, Ory'hara," he begins with a kind of intense casualness, "all of it good.  Thus far Mu'Randa's naming of you has been proved right."You look at him for a moment to gauge his temperament before asking him if he can enlighten you about the importance of this 'Ory'hara' business.  He looks at you for several seconds before replying."No, I don't think I can," he tells you quietly.  "I want to give you every chance of proving yourself worthy of the name given to you, and I don't think that you could do that if you were forewarned and forearmed.  Not that I actually know that much about your trials to come: the future is far too fluid and prophecy is such an imprecise art, not even the Vell-os ever mastered it completely."In the meantime," he asks, changing the subject, "when do we leave?"Upon landing you are greeted by a stunning woman with ash-blonde hair and big blue eyes."Hi, I'm Mu'Feren," she introduces herself delicately, "and if I'm not mistaken, you are Ory'hara?"You nod, wondering if she too is somehow testing you as well.  As you think this you almost reflexively open your mind and begin observing the way she moves the weaves around herself.  Almost at once you sense that she can detect you observing her in this deeper fashion and you surmise that she is a telepath."Oh no," she shakes her head at your unspoken question, "I have heard of a great many of your deeds, and have heard even more about the way you are developing.  I guess that you could call me a believer of sorts.  I think that you will become the Ory'hara the legends speak of."In the meantime," she continues quietly with a slight smile, "I believe we need to get to <RST> in the <RSY> system?"%Llyrell greets you when you land."You know that I must resist as strongly as I can," he tells you almost formally.  You nod, and the two of you begin.In the following minutes both of you weave ever more complex flows, and while you have the advantage of being able to merge with the universe, Llyrell's telepathic attacks force you to use your abilities to defend your mind from his telepathic attacks rather than for attacking him.Finally, in an effort to protect your mind, you merge completely with the spirit of the universe, losing all sense of self.  In that moment your intellect vastens to touch every point in the universe at one time, and for a second you know everything about the universe.  In your last moments of union, before your mind shudders back from the inconceivable, you use your power to create a weave that smashes through Llyrell's defenses."Ory'hara," he murmurs as he falls unconscious.  You quickly drag him onto your ship away from the many bystanders who had stopped to watch the fight.As soon as you entered Krypt space you were forced to defend Llyrell from constant attacks by the Krypt-mind.  For weeks you stay immersed in the spirit of the universe until you are sure that you have gone insane.  But after the first few moments it feels almost natural, and you can sense Krypt's rising panic as she cannot penetrate your defenses.As a part of your enormously vastened perceptions, you almost unconsciously land on the surface of Vell-os, and observe Llyrell leaving the ship for a time.  You sense him cast about with his mind, looking for a psychic trace of the Krypt-tokh.  With a small weave amongst the millions of weaves you are willing into existence to foil the Krypt-mind you draw his attention to what he is looking for.He returns to the ship, and you can sense his awe at what you have shown you can do."I felt the word 'Korell'," he says quietly, aware that you already know, "and that was a planet once populated by us.  I suggest we go there."You nod, and you take off again..When your passengers recognize the planet your are landing on a few look puzzled, others look sad, but only three, Iuso, Mu'Randa and Bis Andreya, look grim.  As soon as you touch down you usher everyone off the ship."You truly are a warrior for our people," says Tre'Inari, one of the leaders of the Tre'pira, after a long silence.  "Only one as great as yourself would even contemplate sacrificing yourself for all of humanity."You smile a sad smile, and shake your head."It is not Ory'hara's place to sacrifice {G"himself" "herself"} to get us out of our problems," lectures Iuso quietly.  "It is not {G"he" "she"} that will be sacrificed for humanity.  That honor is saved for ourselves.""Soon the Polaris will be no more," agrees Bis Andreya sadly.  "We must destroy ourselves for the good of humanity."Thank you, Ory'hara," she says, turning to you.  "You have shown us the way.  We remain in your debt."You shake your head, before indicating that everyone should return to your ship for the trip back to Kel'ar Iy.As soon as you land you send word to the head office that you have a serious offer for them to consider, and in moments you are shuffled to the head of their appointments list.As soon as you enter you see a number of businessmen and women dressed in suits seated waiting you.  As soon as the introductions start you realize that these men and women are the people in charge of United Shipping's business affairs.Without wasting any more time than necessary you quickly outline the Polaris proposal in full, and after a quick show of hands, the United Shipping board of directors votes to send a representative to help the new trade avenues along."I believe that you know Samantha," says the chairman, and you grin happily when you recognize your former shipmate from the Auroran trade talks.  "She will go with you back to the Polaris to begin setting up links between us."9You are amazed by the god-like depths of intelligence you sense in the weavings of the Krypt-mind during your journey.  As soon as you enter the physical space occupied by this intelligence, you find yourself constantly under attack by the Krypt, and it slowly works away at your defenses.  As soon as you begin piloting down to the surface of Vellos, the attacks stop, offering you some respite.  And as you make your way through the atmosphere of this destroyed world you can feel Krypt focus its attention down to the surface.When you step out you see an obsidian colored nude female figure striding towards your ship."What are you?" she asks abruptly, and instantly you can sense Krypt's enormous intelligence in the figure before you.  "Why did you come here?"Suddenly you are forced to defend your mind against a potentially deadly intrusion as Krypt tries to weave her way inside your head.  You instantly merge with the universe and twist the conditions around you to thwart her attempts, but even then her weaves are almost too intricate to unravel, and you only barely manage to survive.  Then, just as suddenly, the attacks stop."You are interesting," she announces thoughtfully.  "I will watch you."With that her body dissipates into dust and you are left panting with exertion.You are filled with sorrow at the sight of this destroyed world.  You remember hearing the stories of the glorious Vell-os homeworld and its amazing beauty.  Looking around, you cannot help but feel remorse at the actions of your predecessors.  You wander around for as long as your bio-suit will allow.As you get back into your beloved <PSN>, you slowly dry your eyes as your airlock cycles, and you remember the odd 'Krypt Pods' you kept seeing on your way here.  You resolve to ask your Vell-os friend about them when you return, if he is prepared to talk further after hearing the news of the devastation of his homeworld.You quickly make your way through the disorganized <DST> markets to find Arpad's office and get down to the business of getting your supplies.  After haggling with him you know that he has cheated you, but you got the most out of him you could have without arousing his suspicion.Once the deal is made Arpad is more than willing to lend you two of his men to help load up your beloved <PSN>.  Then you head off on your way with your <CQ> tons of <CT> for the Rebellion.As soon as you land you go looking for this Burton guy.  Surprisingly he's not to hard to find.  The <DST> marketplace is very well organized, and within a half-hour, you're standing in front of the man you want, haggling over the price.The two of you quickly reach an agreement, and you get your <CQ> tons of <CT> no questions asked.  He even gets one of his men to give you a hand loading the stuff onto your ship.You casually cast your senses around your local area to ensure that none of the Federation authorities are paying you any obvious attention.  Once you are satisfied you begin running through a quick pre-flight checklist before heading off-planet.As soon as you land you go looking for this Arpad guy.  He is a lot harder to find than Burton was on Las Vegas, as the <DST> marketplace is not nearly as well organized.  However, with the help of your telepathic abilities, after just over an hour of searching, you're standing in front of the man you want, haggling over the price.The two of you quickly reach an agreement, and you get your <CQ> tons of <CT> no questions asked.  He even gets a couple of his men to give you a hand loading the stuff onto your ship.Once again you casually cast your awareness around the area to ensure that none of the Federation authorities are paying you any obvious attention, before running through a quick pre-flight checklist and heading off-planet.You are taken into a darkened room by a dockworker who refuses to be drawn into conversation."Hello, my pretty," comes that horrifically beautiful voice.  "Report."You make your report and she grills you about the extraction and the appearance of General Smart.  With the enslavement device attached to the nape of your neck, you have no hope of resisting her questioning."Good!" the voice decides finally, "you have done well!  Now we must start using your position to best advantage."From here on," she commands, "I want you to bring any rebels you pick up here and we will do a quick body switch, so that we can start planting a few agents in amongst their network.  Hopefully they will start getting you to place agents in the future, and then we will be really getting somewhere."In the mean time," she continues meaningfully, "I want you to deliver this message pod to my man in the bar on the Kane Band, at Earth.  You know who he is.  He'll meet you when you land."You land and go through your normal post-flight checklist as normal.  When you are finished you head outside to stretch your legs and sadly await the arrival of your passenger.Within five minutes he arrives and you bring him on board giving him the regulation five minute tour.  Then you head back up to your cockpit to begin preparing to take him off to <RST> in the <RSY> system in accordance with Commander Krane's commands.  As you head out into space your mood is as somber as the sky.#Without leaving your ship you can sense the enormous amount of damage being done by the Federation soldiers all over the station.  You estimate that in a few hours this station will be virtually depopulated and practically uninhabitable.Despite the large number of men committed to this mission, you sense from General Sutton that this mission is more for show than anything else, and you guess that this must be a diversion for a much larger main push elsewhere.  Not that this mission is proceeding perfectly; you can sense the spirited resistance of the Moash warriors and by the sound of the reports coming through your comm unit these disorganized pockets of men are acquitting themselves admirably.Despite this, they are overwhelmed by sheer numbers and by the enormous amounts of firepower brought to bear upon them.  A little over four hours after landing you see the short blonde hair and tall broad figure of General Sutton coming aboard."That's it for us," he informs you casually.  "We're finished here."It only takes you moments to locate the person you are searching for because the Mu'hari's mind has been brought up in a social environment vastly different to what is experienced within the Federation, and to a telepath it stands out like a beacon.With a heavy heart you weave into existence your protective barrier and head out into space to start your journey to <RST> to make your report.It takes you a lot longer to locate your suspect than you had anticipated, and when you finally do find him, you realize why.  He is merely a rebel informant, and has none of the obvious indicators of having grown up in a totally foreign culture to mark his mind as being drastically different to those around him.Your momentary jubilation is quickly tempered by the knowledge that this man will soon be going through the most terrifying ordeal of his life when the Bureau start trying to extract every last drop of information out of him.You head back to the spaceport with a heavy heart to start your journey to <RST> to make your report as the now-familiar feelings of depression settle over you.It takes you a lot longer to locate your suspect than you had anticipated, and when you finally do find her, you realize why.  She is merely a rebel informant, and has none of the obvious indicators of having grown up in a totally foreign culture to mark her mind as being drastically different to those around her.Your momentary jubilation is quickly tempered by the knowledge that this woman will soon be going through the most terrifying ordeal of her life when the Bureau start trying to extract every last drop of information out of her.You head back to the spaceport with a heavy heart to start your journey to <RST> to make your report as the now-familiar feelings of depression settle over you.As soon as you land you can feel the buzz of an intelligence network swirling around you.  You can sense more than a few T4's and T5's trying to read your intent, but you easily blunt their attempts to observe you.You quickly cast your mind around, and you can sense that a large number of the people working here consider themselves to be members of the Mu'hari, and this confirms your suspicions.  Without even dissolving your protective shell you take off again leaving the Polaris wondering as to your motives in landing.As you start your long journey back to Sol, you catch flashes of awe coming from the Polaris on the planet, and you realize that Krane was correct that these people still feel indebted to the Vell-os for what they did for them.  You cannot help but laugh quietly at the thought that an advanced civilization like the Polaris can still mistake you for a Vell-os.It takes you mere moments to locate the woman you are sent to find, because her mind shows obvious signs of having telepathic ability.  After a few moments of careful weaving you gently touch her mind and sense that while she has the ability to become a T4, she has yet to learn how to manipulate matter and so is still a T5.  She is a fairly skilled one, and a couple of times you are forced to cleverly weave around your probe to stop her from detecting it.You realize now how Llyrell must have felt when he first saw you.  You have no choice but to report that this brave young woman has telepathic ability, despite the fact that you know what she will soon go through.  As you put up your protective barrier, you find yourself hoping against hope that the Bureau will decide to kill her rather than risk trying to enslave her.But as you point yourself in the direction of <RST> in the <RSY> system, you know that the Bureau will never allow such a tempting fish to slip through their fingers.Upon landing you head over to the dockmaster's office to inquire if the package you are supposed to be picking up is available.  He directs you to the Deliveries Office and they quickly find your package and hand it over.You head down to the Deliveries Office to pick up your package and they give you a hand loading it onto your ship.As soon as you land you head over to the offices of the dockmaster and when you eventually locate her she turns out to be {b206 "a fellow warrior" "another of these savagely tattooed Aurorans"}.  She hands over the package to be delivered {b206 "with a respectful nod" "without comment or question"}.  You get the feeling that she {b206 "has not seen too many warriors during her current posting" "does not like you very much for some reason"}.You head over to the Deliveries Office to pick up your cargo of <CQ> tons of <CT>.  The staff give you a hand to load it on your vessel.You leave the ship and make your way to the merchants' warehouse without speaking to a soul.  The staff there spend nearly an hour finding your cargo amongst the chaotic arrangement of crates in the room.  Then when they finally find the crate you want they get annoyed when you ask for some help to load it onto your ship, but in the end they grudgingly lend you a hand to load it on board.'You leave the ship and make your way to the merchants warehouse without speaking to a soul.  The staff there seem to know exactly where to find your cargo which is unusual and makes you slightly suspicious about the information you are bringing back to the Federation.  They still get annoyed when you ask for some help to load it onto your ship, which almost comes as a relief - at least they are acting normally in that regard.  They complain vociferously but they end up grudgingly giving you a hand to load it.You land on <DST> only to find out that the planet is in the middle of a dockworkers strike.  The Federation have removed the dock management, and accused them of being rebel sympathizers.  This has caused the workers to 'down tools' and head for the pub.You head for the consignment office and ask for Billy Booya.  A few minutes later, a harried looking man walks over to you."Can I help you?" he grunts, barely keeping a civil tone.  You explain to him that you are waiting for an urgent consignment, and that you are unable to receive it. "You and every other bloody spacer in this port," he snaps "What makes your case so special?"By way of answer you hand him the data pad that Olaf gave to you.  He reads it, and without thought, picks up a microphone and calls through the loud speaker, "McCauliffe, Spacey, Pitts and Williams, report to bay 96!"Booya tells you that he didn't realize that the Shipment was for Olaf.  They will load your cargo as quickly as possible.  You thank him and head down to your ship.The Cargo handlers load your ship with good cheer, explaining that Olaf had helped out fellow workers on a dozen or more systems in the past, and it was their pleasure to load his cargo for you.Before too long, you are headed back to <RST>.You find "Ryan's Last Chance" drifting aimlessly.  Your sensors find no one has moved on that ship for centuries.  Your crew are dubious about making the transfer, and you must admit, the thought of setting foot on the derelict makes you shudder.Moving through the airlock in your e-suit, your torch beams plumb the depths of the darkness.  Around you are the floating bodies of the crew, vacuum desiccated.  Their corpses drift, like reminders of the souls that still haunt this place.  You quickly organize the cargo transfer, then try to retrieve the captains log.  Only the final few words remain:"...foolish endeavor to bring this ship home.  Truly......last......chance....finally......death......signing......off"One poor man had managed to hole himself up in a tiny pressurized area, but had finally died of starvation, or asphyxiation.  Over time the cold harsh unforgiving hands of space have finally breached this final bastion, and now claim the entire wreck as its own.  You shudder, imagining the few moments before the end...alone...cold...waiting for death...hoping against hope that a ship might come to your aid.  You head back to the warmth and comfort of your ship, glad to be leaving the ghosts behind.You are surprised that no one is there to meet you at the spaceport.  Your most trusted contacts had organized the exchange, and the Sutherlands should have been here by now.  You glance at your chronoputer, and suddenly realize your mistake.  The 'Dampener' has saved you so much time in warp that you are two days early for your meeting.  You spend a fruitless two days hanging around the port, knowing that there is no point in pressurizing the situation, since it wouldn't get Denise, Rodger and Jenny out any faster.  Finally the time comes, and right on schedule, the contact arrives with the Sutherlands.  You are about to take off, when you hear the klaxons sounding.You realize that something (or someone) has given the game away, and quickly blast off the station, breaking several laws in the process.  A fleet is coming your way, but you think you can handle it...You quickly find the consignment of <CQ> tons of <CT> that you are after.  The loading staff are very helpful and in under an hour you are ready to begin your return trip.Trying to look like you know what you are doing you head down to what appears to be the bays where the Polaris repair their damaged ships.  You get a few odd looks, but luckily nobody asks you any questions.  You walk around and take a few surreptitious snaps of a Wraith Cannon as it is being re-attached to an Arachnid, and take a few quick pictures of a series of the fluorescent purple packets of energy that are called the Wraithii as they are loaded on board as well.Remaining casual you make your way back to your ship and stow away your pictures before heading out into space to try to slip through the Polaris defense net and make your way back to <RST> in the <RSY> system.You land under heavy fire, and the workers on the ground grimly tell you that they are capable of holding out against the pirates, as the pirates aren't prepared to bombard them from orbit because they do not want to destroy the mining infrastructure that has been set up."But we are more than a match for them on the ground," the operation commander informs you grimly.  "The trouble is that they just sit in space, and every ship that takes off gets beaten to hell.  So far, every ship that has managed to land has been disabled and boarded as soon as they leave the atmosphere.  Good luck out there."With a sigh, you head back to your beloved <PSN>.You break quite a sweat as you load the cargo into the hold of your ship.  As you work, you cannot help but wonder what your uncle has been up to for the last 10 years...JA group of Federation dockworkers is being escorted by a large squad of Security Police.  You begin to think about how many eyes are watching the cargo being loaded, and noting the name of your ship, its armaments (or lack thereof) and passing the information on to much more dangerous others.  It makes your skin crawl, but it would do serious damage to your reputation to back out at such a late stage.  You just have to go ahead with it, keep your eyes open, and hope for the best.  It is with a rueful smile that you kiss goodbye your anonymity.A group of Federation dockworkers is being escorted by a large squad of Security Police.  You begin to think about how many eyes are watching the cargo being loaded, and noting the name of your ship, its armaments (or lack thereof) and passing the information on to much more dangerous others.  It makes your skin crawl, but it would do serious damage to your reputation to back out at such a late stage.You just have to go ahead with it, keep your eyes open, and hope for the best.  It is with a rueful smile that you realize that people are going to start putting two and two together and figure out that you are now working for Olaf.YBlind Charlie turns out to be quite easy to find.  You find him working in a safe house for the Association, making money off the others there by telling them what the people in the next room are doing or saying.  Another of his favorite tricks is to get people to throw things in the air, and let Charlie catch them.  When you ask him how it is done, he smiles and tells you that he can hear them moving through the air, and the sound of the air being pushed aside.  It is all pretty amazing.You shake your head, and start going through your pre-flight routine.Olaf hands you a full stein of ale, and you silently raise it in memory of those who will never drink with you again.  The rebels were already prepared for your arrival, and the wounded are swiftly taken to hospitals and to medical stations whose doctors ask no questions.  As their repair crew gets to work you take stock of the situation.  Your ammunition stocks are depleted and there are some badly damaged ships in your fleet.  Others will never sail again..."We'll need to take those captured databanks to Rebel I in the Evlei system," muses Olaf quietly, obviously uncomfortable to disturb you during your reverie.  "That is the place where the rebel code-breakers are currently hiding.  Those guys and their computers will soon have the ciphers broken and the information pouring out to us."  You nod in agreement, hoping that the decoding won't take too long.Once the supplies have been loaded and the damaged sections have been repaired, you instruct Mr. Flynn to take her out, and ask Dala to set course for <RST>.  You hope that this trip will be less action packed than the last, but you doubt it, and so you take along what's left of your fleet to ensure that the data package reaches the decoders....As you drop down towards the spaceport you locate the base of the traitors and blast your way into it, dumping the explosives as quickly as possible before flying away.  After making it to a safe distance you set off the explosives, utterly destroying the facility.?After avoiding the orbital patrols you and Flynn quickly move through the facility smashing and killing everything you come across.  Flynn is just a whirling dervish of destruction and whenever you find yourself getting pinned down he somehow manages to pull off the impossible and pull you out of trouble.After the better part of an hour of fighting your way through the crashed ship, everything is quiet and Flynn plants his charges and the two of you take off as soon as possible to avoid any further entanglements with pirate goons.Dockworkers swarm over your craft unloading your cargo in a quick and efficient manner, making sure that the hand over of goods to the Federation Navy is a complete success.You look on as the prisoner is dragged away under heavy guard.The leader of the team you ferried back here comes over and thanks you for your help.  He tells you that Commander Krane would like to see you before you go.You look on as the prisoner is dragged away under heavy guard.  You cannot help wondering what was done to the woman to change her from a daring spy into a pathetic and spineless shadow.You shake yourself out of your reverie as the leader of the team you ferried back here comes over and thanks you for your help.  He tells you that Commander Krane would like to see you before you go.You look on as the prisoner is dragged away under heavy guard.  The suspicions about his true occupation remain, but you remain silent as he is marched off your ship.You shake yourself out of your reverie as the leader of the team you ferried back here comes over and thanks you for your help.  She politely passes on the message that Commander Krane would like to see you before you leave.You look on as Faran Kurik is dragged away under relatively light guard.  Your questions regarding the tactics used by the Bureau in this 'war' remain, but for now you have continued to stay loyal to the Bureau, but you get the feeling that crunch time is not too far away.You shake yourself our of your reverie as the leader of the team you ferried back here comes over and thanks you for your help.  She politely passes on the message that Commander Krane would like to see you before you leave.You watch impassively as the unconscious former councilor is carried off your ship.  You have made your choice, and your loyalty lies here, with the only organization that has the ability to do what needs to be done to take humanity beyond its current bickering state and on into a glorious future.  If there are a few casualties along the way, so what?Without even being politely reminded you head off to Krane's office to find out if she fully trusts you now.As you exit your ship you see the soldier who has been your link to Krane sitting nearby in a seat that affords excellent visibility.  You walk up and drop the message pod in front of him.  Without a word he punches a long string of numbers into the encryption lock and reads the contents.He looks up and in clipped tones says, "Commander Krane wants you to continue as planned with your infiltration and await the usual 'Prodigal Son' signal before returning here."With that, he closes the message pod and returns to looking around ignoring you.  Obviously, as far as he is concerned this conversation is over.Your passenger thanks you for helping him out as he leaves.  You wish that you could have gotten to know a little more about him, but you doubt that you would have found out much.  These spooks never seem to like talking much.  You wonder what he will end up doing for the Bureau.You look over to see the muscular figure of Jay walking towards you."Good work," he states cheerfully.  "Come to my office, I have a credit chip with your name on it."Surprisingly you see the blonde hair of Commander Krane waiting for you as you exit your ship."Things went well?" she asks by way of greeting.You nod, saying that it would probably be best if you and her could talk in private."{G"I didn't know you felt that way,\" she flutters her eyelashes before laughing. " "Alright then,\" she looks at you slightly quizzically,"} "Follow me."She takes you to the now familiar empty-looking office."So tell me what you saw," she casually commands.You quickly run over what you saw from beginning to end leaving nothing out.  As you finish she looks both impressed and satisfied."Good work!" she praises you sincerely.  "You are more observant than I gave you credit for.  From your report we have to make a couple of minor adjustments to our intel picture, but nothing that should put us off our timetable."^As soon as you land you are escorted by Bureau soldiers to meet with the Moash House elders.  You find them seated in chairs looking unhappy to be surrounded by heavily armed guards.You sit down at the head of the table and quickly outline the terms of Krane's proposal.  When you finish they stir, looking a little excited.  You allow them to confer amongst themselves quietly for a few minutes until they turn back to you."How can we trust you and your masters?" asks the eldest-looking warrior of the group.You smile and say that they can either have faith or be destroyed.  But you go on to say that the Bureau will only betray any organization that is no longer useful to them.  You go on to explain that the Bureau has no wish to be tied down by the duties of direct rule, it prefers to operate behind the scenes.As soon as you land you are greeted by a savagely tattooed Moash warrior who leads you to a council chamber where the elders are in a meeting.  You are surprised to see very few Federation or Bureau people around.You hand over the message pod to the old warrior at the head of the table and step back.  He manages to fumble his way through opening it without making any major mistakes and begins to scan the contents.  After a few minutes he looks up at you and nods, thanking you for your delivery.You walk back to your beloved '<PSN>' under the escort of the same warrior who took you to the elders.  As soon as you reach your ship he nods in farewell and you start preparing for the journey back to <RST>.@Upon landing you are escorted by a savagely tattooed Moash warrior to the chambers of the House elders.  This time you fail to see even one Federation citizen.  Obviously the Bureau feels as though it can completely trust the Moash House.You hand over the message pod to the same old warrior as last time and watch him open it.  After taking a few minutes to scan the contents he turns to you and thanks you for your services.You are escorted back to your beloved '<PSN>' by a different young warrior who watches you like he is waiting for you to make some kind of move.  You do not give him the satisfaction and when you reach your ship you thank him in as sincere a voice as you can muster.  You get no small amount of delight when you see the anger on his face at your condescending tone.After completing your post-flight routine you head out of your ship wondering how this Dorraj Rainsford will make contact with you.  Your questions are soon answered when you hear a discreet cough as you step off your ship.  You turn to see a casually dressed man with long black hair, sprinkled with gray, and a moustache.  He unsurprisingly introduces himself as Dorraj and asks if you have a package for him.You tell him to follow you and you open your hold revealing the message pod.  As he opens it using a complex key-sequence you study him closely.  Something strikes you as being slightly out of place, and then you notice that while his hair is shot through with gray, his moustache is not.  On further examination, you realize that both his hair and moustache are fake.You are slightly stunned to find out that underneath his wig, moustache and some other subtle touches of makeup you recognize him.  He is the President of the Federation, Mr. P. Milamber.?Upon landing you are met by the {G"stunning" "disgustingly attractive"} Krane and she takes you into a seemingly deserted office.  When you enter you are surprised to see the familiar figure of the rebel Captain Daniels wearing a Bureau uniform."I've just received a transmission from Federation Command reporting that the Carrier Group has taken heavy casualties but has managed to destroy the rebels' headquarters," she tells you with a small smile.  "I believe they gave you information on its whereabouts?"You hand over the data crystal and, somewhat distractedly, give a quick summary of events from your mission."You will be happy to know that the Rebel leaders have been taken into custody," Daniels informs you quietly.  "As of now, the rebellion is destroyed."Krane recognizes the confused expression on your face."Do you remember that the former head of Federation Intel, a man code-named Frandall, was the head of the rebel intelligence network?" she asks, and you nod.  "Well, let me introduce Frandall, the head of the Bureau."Upon landing you are escorted by two savagely tattooed Moash warriors to the chambers of the House elders.  You notice a new air of optimism on the faces of the many warriors you pass on the way.You hand over the message pod to the same old warrior as last time and watch him open it.  After taking a few minutes to scan the contents he turns to you and thanks you for your services.You are escorted back to your beloved '<PSN>' by the same two warriors who do not seem to be worried at all about your safety or actions.  Obviously the warriors of the Moash House have learned to deal with their new status as vassals of the Bureau, and are confident about their planned takeover of Auroran Space.As you often do when you enter a system that you intend landing in, you decide to check out the news band of the system's comm-net.  You are a little surprised to hear that the Federation Navy is starting to gain the upper-hand after the terrible strikes made by the Aurorans a few weeks ago.After listening for a while you start to realize that everything seems to have gone according to plan, and that the Federation, with the help of its Moash vassals are systematically destroying 'strategic' targets.  You would be willing to bet that these targets are more than likely only strategic to the other four major Auroran houses.You chuckle when you hear some editorial comments saying that the war will have to end soon, as the Federation cannot afford to overextend itself.  It seems that the Bureau plan included a mechanism to stop the war at the desired time, after exactly the right amount of damage was inflicted.  It makes you glad that you decided to work for the right team.You land carefully, all the time aware that the Polaris war-ships are watching you every second of the way.  You take your time over your post-flight routine to steady your nerves before heading out to see what awaits you on this marvel of a world.You are met by two gray-cloaked men who indicate that you should follow them.  As you fall in behind one, the other falls in behind you in a classic guarding maneuver.  You cannot help but feel his eyes boring into your back.You travel through several corridors and lifts before arriving in what appears to be a simple boardroom with a large central table around which sit twenty-five elderly people.  They are all garbed in brown, but you notice that, except for the woman at the head of the table, their collars are of differing colors.  Eight of them have white collars, six have green, five blue, four gray and one black.  You wonder what the significance is.  The woman at the head of the table is the only one whose collar matches the color of her robe.2After having a quick look around you realize that this is the 'home-world' of the warrior caste.  While the Nil'a Ca station is their battle headquarters, this planet is their 'spiritual' home.After a few hours of fruitless wandering, you learn that it is useless to try to draw any of these warriors into conversation, as they only seem to be prepared to give you monosyllable answers.  You reckon that this is something Krane and Frandall would want to know about, so you decide to head back to <RST> to make your report.Bis Andreya is met by an official party headed by the Vice-President of the Federation, and after they move you see Commander Krane who indicates that you should follow her.  She takes you through a series of corridors before you enter a room with a large screen at one end.After a few moments Frandall enters and he greets you jovially."Good work '<SRK>'," he tells you cheerfully.  "Keep an eye on the screen.  The vision is supplied courtesy of a shielded camera in the council-room that they will be using to sign all the official documents."You are a little mystified, but keep an eye on the monitor as Krane and Frandall make small talk.  Soon enough you see the media file in, and before long the official party, including the Federation Vice President and Bis Andreya who take center stage.The Vice-President makes a brief statement to the media, and ends by looking straight at the camera to this viewscreen and saying that he hopes this alliance will allow both cultures to move forward.When you dock you see a similar tactic used by the Aurorans of four Cruisers deploying ground troops to protect a fifth which is deploying the beacon.  Once again the Auroran warriors on the ground immediately start taking casualties from the Polaris warriors, while the remaining Cruisers try to keep the space around the station now holding the beacon clear of Polaris ships.The beacon is quickly deployed, and the Auroran warriors begin withdrawing back to their ships leaving behind several small rearguard groups so that they can get away cleanly.  With an almost clockwork precision that you would not have expected from the Aurorans, the Cruisers lift off and begin heading out far enough to make the jump to hyperspace.  Your comm beeps, indicating an incoming hail."Thank you for your help <SRK>," says the veteran warrior leading the Auroran task force, "we have been honored to share of your knowledge.  If songs are made about this battle, I will make sure that your part will be remembered."As soon as you land Krane leads you to the President's offices where he is sweating, surrounded with four bodyguards."Glad you could make it, Miss Krane," he welcomes you a little too enthusiastically, "I have a matter that I wanted to discuss with you before I go public with it.""Would this be your planned Bureau budget cut?" she asks casually."Why, ah, yes," he answers, clearly surprised.  "How were you aware of it?""We are aware of many things Mr. President," she informs him in a low tone, "but perhaps you are not.  You do realize that both the Polaris and the Aurorans obey orders directly from the Bureau, and not from the Federation government, don't you?  If these cuts were to go ahead, it would be somewhat catastrophic to your presidency if they were to both attack the Federation simultaneously.  Especially when both governments would, in no uncertain terms, be told by me to assassinate you specifically, Mr. President."Your passenger politely thanks you for helping him out as he leaves, but the small gesture only serves to deepen your helpless mood.  You find yourself wishing once more that you had never gotten involved in this stupid conflict in the first place.  In your despair you begin to imagine all the havoc that will be wrought on the brave Rebels who are caught because of your actions, and you are only just able to stop the tears from pricking your eyes.You look over to see the muscular figure of Jay walking towards you."Good work," he states cheerfully.  "Come to my office, I have a credit chip with your name on it."As soon as you open the hatch you are hailed by a smiling Jay walking along the concourse towards you."I take it you got it," he states with a grin and a wink.You show him your holds and he claps you on the shoulder."Come with me to my office," he says, "and we'll see what can be done about payment and a regular run.  We'll leave the unloading to the people who get paid for it."You gain the attention of some dockworkers and quickly get your cargo unloaded before heading off to check in with Jay and get your payment.As soon as you open the hatch you are hailed by a smiling Jay walking along the concourse towards you."I take it you got what we wanted," he states with a grin and a wink.You bring him aboard and show him your holds and he claps you on the shoulder."Excellent work!" he says.  "Come with me to my office, and we'll see what can be done about payment and another regular run.  There are enough people around here who get paid to do the unloading, so why don't we leave them to it."Over the course of your journey, you learn that Anna is really only an informant.  She only relays information regarding Federation and Bureau activities on to other members of her cell-network.  You are a little impressed at the way the Rebels have set up their informants.  If any one person was 'turned', they could only ever incriminate a maximum of three others, and even then, unless they acted within two days, they could not even do that.Anna thanks you for helping her out as she leaves and you watch her walking away.  You realize that you never did find out the story behind her removal, but then you doubt that she would have told you.  She didn't seem like the blabbing type.You look over to see the muscular figure of Jay walking towards you."You did good out there," he states seriously.  "Come to my office, I have someone I want you to meet."Your passenger thanks you for helping him out as he leaves.  You wish that you could have gotten to know a little more about him, but you doubt that you would have found out much.  These informants never seem like the blabbing type.You look over to see the muscular figure of Jay walking towards you."Good work," he states cheerfully.  "Come to my office, I have credit chip with your name on it."Jay greets you as soon as you open your hatch."Damn, it is good to see you again," he says with a grin and a hint of a tear in his eye.  "I was more than a little worried, I can tell you.  I was sending messages to HQ every few hours don't you know.  I hear that General Smart got pretty irritated about it," he chuckles, "but what are friends for?"You're famous!" he exclaims suddenly after shaking your hand.  "Everybody's talking about you.  The man who somehow overcame the infamous, never before defeated conditioning of the Bureau!  You have given hope to thousands of rebels that even if you are taken, it isn't impossible to make it back, only inexpressively difficult.  You're a hero."You almost collapse with the weight of it all.  You don't feel like a hero, after all didn't you work for the other side until a few weeks ago?  The shame of your actions still burns away inside of you.Fiona thanks you for giving her a lift as she leaves and you watch her walking away.  You realize that, in all likelihood, you will never see her again.  You will never know her story.  Why did she join the Rebels, why is she willing to risk her life and mental health for something as ephemeral as an ideal?  Her retreating back seems a fitting metaphor for the way this war is being carried out.Feeling a strange sense of sadness, you head back up to your cockpit.Your passenger thanks you for the lift as he leaves and, like you do with all of them, you watch him walking away with a strange sense of loss.  You can only admire their courage.  They spend every day in the lair of the beast, and though they might be the ones to discover the piece of information that will bring down the Bureau, but they will never be recognized for their efforts.Feeling a strange sense of sad pride, you head back up to your cockpit.On the express orders of your passenger Mu'Randa, you make no contact with the Rebels until you begin the docking sequence.  You radio out that you have a representative of the Polaris government on board wanting to meet with the leaders of the Rebellion.  After you finish relaying the information you sit back with a smile."What are you smiling at?" inquires your passenger politely.You reply that you are thinking about the mad chaos that would be resulting from the message you just sent.  You chuckle at the thought of Rebel officers running around trying to get as many head sheds together as possible given the time frame.As soon as you finish your post-flight check list you lead your passenger out into the waiting station.You step out of your ship to be greeted by General Smart, Dr. Oriallo Pentecost and Cardinal Vardy de Valera."Excellent work, Ory-Hara," exclaims General Smart in greeting."This may prove to be a turning point in our battle," agrees Dr. Pentecost."It seems the Gods are with us," replies Cardinal de Valera, "for they have blessed us with the best gift of all; resourceful and devoted people who are prepared to serve in whatever extraordinary circumstances arise."You shift uncomfortably under the praise of these men."And don't worry about our intel failure in alerting the Federation to your mission," General Smart informs you sternly.  "Steps are being carried out to eliminate that threat."We wanted to thank you for your efforts in liaising with the Polaris," he continues seriously, "and to praise your exploits in piloting past the Federation blockade undetected.  It is good to know that people like you are on our side, as I would hate to think of what could happen if you weren't."As soon as you land your ship is overrun by rude techies who have no consideration for the rules of your ship.  You get annoyed and throw them out until you finish your post-flight routine.You walk out and give them an ear-bashing about giving a pilot and his ship a little consideration next time.  They are very apologetic and you decide to let them get back to their work.As they tentatively go about their business you turn to see Geoff looking at you with a large smirk on his face."They don't get put in their place very often," he comments laughing.  "They normally get free run because we need everything they can come up with.  You've made an old hand very happy.  Come to the intel office and we'll have a look at the preliminary findings."On the way back Geoff {b818 "tries to tell you some of Flannigan's history, but you laugh at him, telling him that he is an old friend of yours, and that you probably know more about him than he does.\"Oh yes,\" he murmurs quietly, \"I had forgotten that you have been knighted by them.\"" "explains that Eamon Flannigan is a very capable man.  Apparently the man has been initiated as an Auroran warrior of the Heraan House, and the heron tattooed on his face symbolizes his mastery of their martial arts.\"Only three or four Heron masters are known to exist,\" he explains seriously."}He explains away his presence by saying that he knew you were going to be turning up sometime, so he got dropped off there and just waited.Geoff greets you grimly as you step off your ship."Did you find anything?" he asks hopefully.  You nod and give a rundown on what you discovered.  He looks at you for a long moment with narrowed eyes digesting the information you just gave him."Oh my god!" he exclaims in horror, his eyes widening suddenly.  "They're going to sacrifice Raczak's entire force in order to start a war that the Federation will win!"You look confused and ask how the Federation could defeat the Aurorans in battle.  Conventional military wisdom states that the Federation simply does not have the resources to pacify something the size of the Auroran Empire."Come with me and I will show you how," he replies cryptically.Geoff takes you into an office with a single terminal on a desk.  He quickly calls up a display of information from an analysis from a holo-scanner.r"Greetings Ory-Hara," calls the savagely tattooed Eamon Flannigan as you open your hatch.  "What brings you to my humble abode?"You outline what you know and what your mission is as quickly as you can.  He asks a number of questions regarding the veracity of the intelligence gained which you answer as concisely as possible.  After a few minutes he seems satisfied if slightly stunned."I was aware that the Bureau were working with the Moash House on something," he mutters quietly, "but I wasn't sure it was anything this big."He turns back to you."And what are you planning to do now Ory-Hara?" he asks intently.You reply that you are going to travel to Heraan and Rimerta to talk with the warriors there regarding the coming events."I can see your plan," he nods approvingly, "and it is a good one.  I may be of some assistance."Eamon steps out first and he greets the awaiting warriors in a friendly manner.  They quickly realize that you are under his protection.  They put their weapons away and ignore you.Eamon leads you up a long staircase.  After climbing twenty floors it opens on to the top floor of the arcology.  Seated in leather seats surrounding a large circular table are about twenty elderly warriors with many faded tattoos.Eamon Flannigan walks to a space in their table, formally introduces you and informs them that you wish to speak with them.  The oldest warrior at the table inclines his head and indicates that you should begin.You explain the events of the recent months and explain what the Bureau is planning to do in concord with the Moash House.  Many of these hard old men narrow their eyes when you tell them of the actions of their rival house."So you want us to allow Federation scum into our space to protect them from this Bureau," asks one of the elders after you finish.  "Why should we do this?"You let Eamon off first again to deal with the waiting warriors.  With no small show of disappointment they sheathe their weapons and let you past.Once again Eamon leads you up a staircase to the upper level of the arcology to a room where ten elderly warriors sit in council.  He walks over and introduces you formally indicating that you wish to speak with them.  The ancient warrior at the head of the table tells you kindly that you may begin.You begin telling of the events that have led up to you standing before them, leaving out the names of all the Auroran houses involved so as not to prejudice them in any way.  You explain what you believe is going to happen and you ask them to keep their eyes open to watch for any cowardly actions undertaken by any house."Why do you wish to involve us in this matter?" asks one of the warriors.  "How will that help you in your cause to fight against this 'Bureau'?";"It has been good fighting alongside you Ory-Hara," says Eamon as he leaves.  "For in your chosen fields of war you are a true master.  The ancient Gaels called people like you 'warrior-poets', for they understood that to master the arts of war required a {G"man" "woman"} to master {G"his" "her"} soul.  I would be honored to call you my Battle-{G"Brother" "Sister"}."Having travelled extensively throughout Auroran space and learned a little about its warrior culture, you realize that this offer is not given or received lightly.  By offering to become your Battle-Brother, he has indicated that he holds your life to be of much greater value than his own.You are touched and bow deeply, replying that the honor would be entirely yours.  The two of you grip forearms and you both make a small incision on the back of your hands letting your blood mingle."Good luck, my {G"brother" "sister"}," Eamon says by way of farewell.  "If any songs are sung about these days I will make sure that your name is mentioned before that of all others."You keep Commander Krane on board until the trial despite the protestations of the Federation media.  The trial itself is an enormous affair, being publicized live Federation-wide.Commander Krane stands before a traditionally long-haired Vell-os judge and a bailiff who will read out the list of crimes she is accused of.The bailiff begins reading out the charges which range from breaching freedom of speech to imprisonment without trial; from unlawful execution to provoking war with other nations and entering into coalitions with pirate organizations.  The final two charges are of treason and of usurping executive power away from the democratically elected representative government.After spending some minutes reading out the charges, the bailiff looks up from his datapad and asks Commander Krane formally:  "How do you plead?"She answers with a resounding, "Not guilty!"The Vell-os judge stands up and looks her directly in the face:  "She lies!"The crowd erupts.Almost before you land it seems like your ship is surrounded by the media in a frenzy after hearing the news that the remainder of the rebel leaders have returned to Federation space.  One by one they step out, waving for the cameras before being whisked away by rebel soldiers who have drawn bodyguard duty.  As soon as they are gone things calm down and you get to relax a little and start taking care of your somewhat battered ship.A few days later, as you are fiddling away on a power coupling that isn't working to its maximum efficiency, you hear the proclamation by the rebel leaders announcing the defeat of the Bureau and most of its forces.  General Smart goes on to inform the citizens of the Federation about the recent machinations of the Bureau in attempting to provoke a war with the Aurorans.  Finally, Dr. Pentecost asks the Federation President to step down and call a general election....and so it ends.Dr. Oriallo Pentecost was elected the new President of the Federation, and his first proclamation was to free every single Vell-os from the bonds of slavery, whereupon they all left Federation space to journey into the galactic North-West to pay their respects to what they had been before passing beyond the physical universe.The Federation, under the guidance of Dr. Pentecost, with the help of his fellow former rebel leaders, entered a new golden age.  On his death bed some twenty-three years later Dr. Pentecost signed the documents welcoming both the Aurorans and the Polaris into the Federation.  After letting the pen slip from his fingers, he sighed and looked around at the men who had been his dearest friends and fellow conspirators during his life.He said one word: "Ory'hara," and died.Later, when pressed, the people who were present at the signing only smiled cryptically and left the question unanswered.On the express orders of your passenger Mu'Randa, you make no contact with the Rebels until you begin the docking sequence.  You radio out that you have a representative of the Polaris government on board wanting to meet with the leaders of the Rebellion.  After you finish relaying the information you sit back with a smile."What are you smiling at?" inquires Mu'Randa with a small smile.You reply that you are thinking about the mad chaos that would be resulting from the message you just sent.  You chuckle at the thought of Rebel officers running around trying to get as many head sheds together as possible given the time frame.As soon as you finish your post-flight check list you lead your passenger out into the waiting station.You step out of your ship to be greeted by General Smart, Dr. Oriallo Pentecost and Cardinal Vardy de Valera."Excellent work Ory-Hara," exclaims General Smart in greeting."This may prove to be a turning point in our battle," agrees Dr. Pentecost."It seems the Gods are with us," replies Cardinal de Valera, "for he has blessed us with the best gift of all; resourceful and devoted people who are prepared to serve in whatever extraordinary circumstances arise."You shift uncomfortably under the praise of these men."And don't worry about our intel failure in alerting the Federation to your mission," General Smart informs you sternly.  "Steps are being carried out to eliminate that threat."We wanted to thank you for your efforts in liaising with the Polaris," he continues seriously, "and to praise your exploits in piloting past the Federation blockade without being destroyed.  It is good to know that people like you are on our side, as I would hate to think of what could happen if you weren't."Heraan medics are awaiting your ship, per the instructions you transmitted upon entering the system.  They take over the care of the spy, who is starting to look better since Moash warriors stopped trying to bludgeon his skull with their bare hands.  He waves his thanks as they walk him away on a grav-stretcher.  You wave back, before heading for debriefing.$Heraan Technicians run away with the samples you have stolen, and with the file copy you retrieved for them.  They quickly ask if you have had a chance to look at the various inventions, and if you have any ideas or thoughts on them.  You tell them that they will have to wait for you to report, but that you would be glad to help them perfect their designs at a later stage.  One of the techs suggests that you discuss it over a couple of drinks in the bar, and you readily agree.  You head off for debriefing.You arrive on Korell with your crew on the verge of collapse.  They have been fighting solidly for hours, round the clock, without complaint.On landing the Vell-os quickly begin scanning for the artifact they require and your crew escorts the Vell-os as they search.  They lead you into the depths of a large cavern.  Soon you stand before a large altar, carved entirely from a glowing crystal.  You and your men stand in awe, as the Vell-os encircle the altar, standing equal distances apart.  As you watch, they begin to glow dimly, growing in intensity, until they cannot be looked at directly.Suddenly there is a burst of blaster fire from the cavern entrance, and Federation troops stream into view.  Your warriors return fire.  Abruptly the glow stops, and the cavern is pitched into total darkness.  After a pause, the battle rages again with IR goggles.The Vell-os move towards the feds as one, blocking blaster bolts.  The Federation troops drop their weapons, shouting, and before their eyes, they melt.  They retreat back around the bend.The ground then rises, climbing to seal off the tunnel.  Llanwyn steps forward, and tells you that the power released during their ceremony has enabled the men and women before you to gain immense power over the physical world.  However, they need to rest before they are able to vaporize another tunnel to the surface....and so it ends.Dr. Oriallo Pentecost was elected the new President of the Federation, and his first action upon entering the office was to disband the Bureau of Internal Investigation.  The resulting surplus of funds was then used to pay for thousands of new schools, hospitals and exploration ventures, looking to expand the frontiers of human expansion.The Federation, under the guidance of Dr. Pentecost, with the help of his fellow former rebel leaders, entered a new golden age.  On his death bed some twenty-three years later Dr. Pentecost signed the documents welcoming both the Aurorans and the Polaris into the Federation.  After letting the pen slip from his fingers, he sighed and looked around at the men who had been his dearest friends and fellow conspirators during his life.He said one word: "Ory'hara," and died.Later, when pressed, the people who were present at the signing only smiled cryptically and left the question unanswered."You do know, {G"Mr." "Ms."} 'Ory-Hara'," the {G"stunningly" "disgustingly"} attractive Commander Krane informs you, "that you are going to be killed when my people find you.  If you return me now I will reward you by making you one of my lieutenants where you will have an enormous amount of power and influence.  What do you say?"You snort quietly to yourself at her attempts to buy you off.  You ignore her continuing attempts as you pilot your ship into the docking bay.After completing your post-flight routine you pick her up and march her out to the waiting reception.  You are greeted by all the Rebel leaders except Frandall, who is nowhere to be seen.The {G"beautiful" "coldly attractive"} Krane looks at them imperiously and asks them what it feels like to be fighting on the losing side, especially now that the Bureau knows of the location of this base.General Smart laughs, "You may find that not all your information regarding this station is completely correct.  Take her away!"During the journey the two Nil'kemorya teach you a great many things about their art.  The three of you spend countless hours sparring and showing each other techniques.  By the end of your trip you are consistently defeating both of them, but not by much, and never when they fight together.You are greeted by a green-robed woman whom Mu'Randa introduces as Ver'Lahir.  She indicates that you should all follow her and she leads you into an observation booth looking down into a laboratory.  Beneath you, you see a man lying down with a complex device fitted to the base of his skull surrounded by ten sweating Polarans of varying classes.  Observing closer you sense that the surrounding people are all very strong telepaths and they are trying to somehow 'lift' some kind of 'weight' away from the mind of the prone patient.  Suddenly you understand that the Polaris are trying to find a way of temporarily 'taking the strain' away from the prone man who is 'enslaved' by the device attached to his skull.You are slightly surprised to see the slim, attractive figure of Mu'Randa, with two gray-cloaked men flanking her waiting for you when you land.  Observing them you sense the enormous potential for violence in the two bodyguards in the deep stillness of the weaves around them.  You guess that these are the Nil'kemorya that Eamon told you about.Observing Mu'Randa closely you can tell that she too is quite capable of violence, but that she is more inclined to use the weaves around her to reach out to people to help them in any way she can.  You can tell by the slightly astonished look on her face that she can sense your observations and you deduce that she must have some telepathic abilities as well."You have Ory'hara!" she exclaims with surprised delight, and the two Nil'kemorya nod as if suddenly understanding the solution to a problem.  Mu'Randa quickly pulls herself together.  "I always thought that your code-name was more than mere coincidence," she murmurs mysteriously.During the journey you tell Eamon that you are finding it difficult to see how well you are progressing fighting against the same person all the time."That's easily fixed," says Raczak as he launches himself murderously at you.To your surprise you knock him down and lock him up with ease."Enough!" commands Eamon and you let go of Raczak who gets up calmly.  Eamon looks at Raczak approvingly, "That was well done, thank you."Raczak just shrugs in reply and you realize that he had deliberately attacked you to allow you to demonstrate to yourself how far you had come.  You realize that there are depths to this man you never recognized before.So when Raczak walks down the ramp to return to his posting, you are not surprised when he turns back to you."I don't know your real name 'Ory-Hara'," he says quietly, "but I will make sure that none of the Roughnecks ever gives you a hard time.  You might be a rebel, but I wish you luck in whatever you decide to do."This time as you land you find it a lot easier as your muscles feel relatively normal compared to after your last mission.  You can feel yourself slowly learning to slip between the flows in your fights with Eamon.  You almost sense that he is having trouble reading you as you can dance between his weaves, without weaving anything yourself.  You are still a long way from defeating a master like Eamon, but you sense that eventually you will surpass even his level of skill."Your skills are progressing well," he tells you after one particularly hard session, "but I'm at a loss to explain your way of dealing with the flow of battle.  It's almost as if you were learning it as a dance rather than a weave.  You trouble me.""It's not really surprising, you buffoon," says your guest Raczak maliciously.  "You couldn't figure your way out of a wet sack, let alone figure out how someone else fights!"Eamon grins suddenly, "I am glad I rescued you Raczak.  It's not often that your enemies owe you so much." You are finding it difficult to work the controls of your ship as your whole body is in pain.  Never in your life have you hurt so much in so many places.  Nor have felt so much respect for the abilities of one man.  In personal combat Eamon is virtually unstoppable, and you have tried attacking every way you can think of, including the use of various weapons.  Nothing has worked.Having said that, you can feel yourself growing stronger, faster and more powerful.  You also feel closer to some sort of breakthrough.  In the last few days you have almost been able to 'feel' the flow of your battles.  You can somehow subliminally sense Eamon weaving the flow around him to suit himself.You have begun to notice too in the past few days that you fall into the cadence of your exercises with surprising ease.  What had initially been excruciatingly difficult has become almost routine.Despite your protesting body, you manage to focus more clearly than you ever have on your piloting and you make it down easily."I am impressed with your skill {b818 "Sir Knight" "Ory-Hara"}," comments Eamon Flannigan as soon as you and your fellow rebel ships land on the planet.  "I believe that it is now our turn."He orders his men to disperse into small units and to destroy all property they can find."Only warriors or people who choose to become combatants are fair game," he warns his men.  "If I even hear of anybody killing civilians, they will have to deal with me.  And I will not be so easy to kill."You remember that Flannigan is a master of unarmed combat and you shiver slightly at the implied threat.In the next few hours the Wild Geese run riot throughout the upper levels of the central arcology and several of the smaller ones.  Casualties are fairly light, but the material damage to what was once the opulent center of Moash space runs upward of several thousand billions of credits.On a windswept plateau overlooking a huge canyon, the only structure your sensors could detect is the ramshackle hut off to your left.  An elderly Auroran warrior walks out of the door.  "You must be <PN>," he rasps, walking back inside without further word.  Hesitantly you follow, into an incongruously technological interior.  The man turns and begins to poke and prod at you."I am Karlaekaar," he says as he lifts your arm and bends it back and forth, "former Heraan martial arts instructor, of the Heron Style."Kuron must think highly of you, {G"boy" "girl"}, or you wouldn't be here."  He continues to scrutinize you.  "Don't think that your time here will be easily spent."He escorts you to a lift.  "It may be some time before you ever see daylight again.  I have spent years developing a form of training that will harden your body and expand your mind, allowing you to begin your journey as a warrior.  Not all of my past students have survived."Karlaekaar teaches you how to cope with the privations of each of the five subterranean levels, as well as training you in the martial arts, until he is satisfied that you could survive in each subterranean world without help.  In a world without days or nights, your training seems to take forever...PBy the time you reach Heraan, you and Bazara have become fast friends.  The trip back has been a vast learning experience for you, as Bazara has told you much of what it means to be a warrior.  Bazara's father was a Thurokiir -  'Obsidian Heart, Arbiter of Reckoning', one of the awesome beings who act as judge, jury and executioner for all of the House's affairs.Bazara confides, "The role of Arbiter is way above me, but we warriors continually strive for the impossible: perfection."The time you've spent with Bazara has been as enjoyable as any you can remember.  As you walk down the ramp together, he turns and clasps your hand warmly."Well, Little Wolf," he smiles, "you've delivered me from a desperate situation, and have followed my trail as unerringly as the cunning hunter whose name I give you.  You're still a pup, but you are well on your way to becoming a Wolf of some renown.  Who knows?  Perhaps one day I will be coming to you for arbitration."He hugs you warmly, and goes to report on the latter part of his mission to the Heraan Council.It is a long and weary journey back to Heraan, with only the attentions of your ship-based Med-Station to heal your wounds.  Some scars will remain with you always, but at least you're not dead.  You quickly grow weary of Bariod's tirades against House Heraan, and his wheedling promises of power and wealth if you would but release him.  Paying him no heed, you deliver him to the Council before you are hurried to one of the arcology's hospitals."The battle was remarkably brief," you tell Techerakh as you dock, "but they were very upset with me by the time I left."  Techerakh chuckles, and nods knowingly.  You get the impression he has done this before.  Together you open the cargo container you captured, and are surprised to see it full of pile upon pile of credit chips.Hunting through, you find a computer pad and quickly run a patch to break into the encoded information.  It takes a while.  You scan the contents.  You are more than a little surprised by what you see!The Bureau were exchanging the cash and containers of weapons and supplies for Moashi spies in return for accelerating operations against the Wild Geese of New Ireland.  They felt that those mercenaries were a threat to the future balance of power in the galactic south, and might hamper operations between the Federation and the Moash Empire.As you walk down the gangplank you find yourself in the most clean and efficient looking spacedock in Auroran space.  You are startled to see men actually polishing the floor with tiny pieces of cloth.  You turn to find a heavily tattooed man before you.  You notice that his tattoos are mostly for battles with the Federation, but there are many from inter-House fighting also.  You notice that there are symbols from kills accredited to all five Houses, but before you can wonder about it too much the man addresses you."<PN> of House Heraan, I am Lo Wang, and I am your sponsor here.  This means that if you do not adapt quickly, you may well find yourself heading home, perhaps breathing, perhaps not.  I am the leader of the Dechtakars.  We are warriors without a House, devoting our lives to serving the Auroran Empire, not just to one of its subsidiary Houses.  It is we who defend the Auroran State from itself, and who act as guardians of Auroran Culture.  We are the buffer between Houses, stopping any blood-letting from getting out of hand.  Please follow me to your lodgings.  Your work will begin tomorrow."The sponsors of the settlers are overgracious with their thanks.  They entertain you with a breathtaking feast, and send the two of you off with a barrel of Nibos, an alcohol so strong it is forbidden on some colonies.  However, Hune has been giving you some lessons in drinking...He tells you of all the different positions within the various Houses, as despite having been a warrior for some time now, you have spent most of your time wandering the galaxy in service to your House and have not had these things explained to you."You have the elders of the Houses who act as a ruling body of advisers," he tells you, "and then you have the Thurokiir (obsidian heart, arbiter of reckoning) and the Mundokiir (heart of crushed garnet, the eye of fury).  The easiest way to think of it is that the Mundokiir is the military head of the warriors of his or her house, in charge of protecting against any of the purely physical dangers.  The Thurokiir on the other hand is the spiritual head of the warriors of his or her house, in charge of protecting against any of the more nefarious threats to their house, be they spiritual, threats to the house's honor, or even espionage and sabotage."QThe Wild Geese gaggle fought valiantly, as {b800 "as you expected" "can only be expected with such opponents"}, but you were finally {b800"able to defeat them" "triumphant"}.  Hune saved your butt more than once with his fancy shooting, and you his.  You celebrate with a little more of that Nibos.  Throughout the night, the two of you{b800" solemnly " " "}salute the many, now departed, {b800"members of the Wild Geese" "valorous enemies"} you faced today, who fought with courage and skill.  More than a few of the young warriors stationed here join the two of you, many openly praising the skill shown by the both of you.  Even the young Moash warriors are complimentary."I cannot wait until I discharge my service to the Empire," says one of the young Moashi, "so that I might test myself against the Heraan.  If all of them are as capable as you, it will be a great challenge!""I look forward to that day," you reply, surprised to find yourself thinking that not all the Moashi are that bad, and that you will be sorry to send this one to the Hall of Heroes.The most intense battle you have ever experienced still resonates within your soul as you enter the Great Hall.  Your near-naked body is adorned with fresh kill tattoos, with the tattoo of Auroran Champion still smarting on your face.  The hall is jammed full of proud warriors.  Thousands of voices roar with approval as you step into the light of the huge bonfires, and you feel your heart almost burst with pride.  Tears well in your eyes as Kuron raises his hands for silence."Little Wolf," he begins, "the days are brief since you stood before us for the first time, yet your achievements nearly cover you.  I have watched you grow into a mighty warrior."You land and immediately make your way to the Empire's Council Hall.  It is immense.  You make small prayers to Death that you will not be lacking in strength for the trial, push open the huge doors and enter.  Shouts of anger and derision hit you like a blow.  The Heraani delegates are looking particularly harried.  You nod in greeting, looking up at their balcony, hoping your presence will give them confidence.  Even though they know that what the Moashi have claimed is untrue, they have no evidence with which to defend themselves.  Soon that will change!  You stride purposefully to the center of the central ring, and await recognition.Bak'ara, the head of the Moashi delegation and chairman of the proceedings raises his hand.  An expectant hush falls over the hall.  "Brothers and Sisters of Aurora, I give you KarHallarn, Thurokiir of House Heraan, come to answer the charges laid against the Heraani by House Moash, namely that they are treasonous dogs and that they are the enemy of all that this Council stands for.  KarHallarn how do you answer?"You take a deep breath.  If your plan is to succeed there is only one way to place your enemies where you wish."Members of the Great Council, I KarHallarn, call upon you an Honor Debt.  The First House is committing the very acts of treason they have charged against House Heraan, to destroy their age-old rival once and for all."A roar erupts from the assembly, and shouts of derision wash over you in wave after wave of anger.  Once some form of order has been restored, you continue."Delegates of the Five Houses, fellow Thurokiirs and Brother warriors, hear my offer.  I pledge the existence of House Heraan as a counterpoint to my debt.  I will see that House Heraan is dismantled, its wealth and resources distributed to the other Houses if I am unable to prove my claims.  But, I demand a debt of Honor of the highest magnitude from all of you, if I can.  All I ask is a small amount of time to prepare my case."The Councillors and delegates look shocked and amazed by your statements.  To refuse is to lose honor.  Slowly, they all signal their assent and you walk from the Hall.All of your 'Pack' have died this day, but the Moashi have been completely routed.Horgar died ramming his ship into the bridge of a Moash Cruiser, Savard while dog-fighting, outnumbered 15 to 1.  Burch'ee of the Cold Death disappeared in a hail of fire, which destroyed the lead cruiser of the second fleet, commanded by the son of Merrick'Ahh.  Jesura claimed scores of enemies before the end, and Bazara carried out a suicide dive through the flight deck of a Moash Carrier, destroying its fighter component before it could even take the field.  Syn'tax overloaded the reactor of his ship to put a Moash Cruiser into the next world.Kuron has lost an arm and a leg.  He directed the last defense while surgeons tried to stop the bleeding.You land on Aurora and march to the Great Hall.  The news of your defeat of House Moash has spread far and wide, and many line the walkways to catch a glimpse of the {G"man" "woman"} who stopped an entire fleet.  The Hall is packed tight with spectators to see the combat between Thurokiirs, an event of great rarity.  Am'Rosso stands across the ring from you, his tattooed flesh glistening.  You casually strip off your clothes and stand before him.  The other three Thurokiirs stand between you.  You recognize Chorga the Insane of Dani House, Jimuga Bloodspiller of Tekel House and Jeorgen the Painted of Vella House.  They nod to you, and you see respect in their eyes.  By tradition, Am'Rosso speaks first to inform all present of the meaning of the duel, and you then reply, before fighting...but not this time."KarHallarn, of House Heraan, I, Am'Rosso call you to stand for your House in this matter.  I demand you rescind the Debt of Honor you have over House Moash through a duel, unarmed, before this council."You take a deep breath..."Am'Rosso, you are without Honor.  Your House of proven treachery cannot be considered a House any longer.  Having plotted to cheat the Auroran Empire of its independence, it did not even have the integrity to step down as First House in the face of incontrovertible evidence.  Just one battle group from House Heraan stalled the cowardly Moashi attack of three fleets on the Heraani heartland, and gave you the greatest military defeat of the century.  I will not lower myself or the Honor of My House to do battle with you, Am'Rosso.  The honor of your House stinks more than the air that comes out of your arse.  You and your House are a blight on all the Auroran Empire stands for."BYou are met by a very graceful individual at the foot of your ships ramp.  "Good day KarHallarn of House Heraan, I am Mu'Randa.""How do you know my name?" you ask, surprised."We have followed your career for some time, <PN>."  You gasp.  No one has called you that in a long time."We have been pleased with the level of skill you have achieved.  We even heard your Thurokiir's Address, and I must say, the Polaris found it very interesting indeed.  Be pleased to come with me, for I am authorized to discuss matters of state with you."You land in the midst of muted celebrations and receive a hero's welcome for your enormous victory, and within minutes you have been filled in on the events of the last few weeks, and all of it has been good.With the death of Krane the hounds of war fell upon a largely unprepared Federation.  Apparently everything has been going well, and the Federation sent out a signal of surrender only two days ago while you were in hyperspace.  Before the end of a month the Rebellion has taken over their desired systems, renaming themselves the Federation House, and the rest are taken over by the Empire.It appears as if all your plans have come to fruition.  Techerakh would have been proud.  You quietly accept the adulation of your fellow Heraani warriors, and, to their surprise, you walk away from the celebrations."What is wrong KarHallarn?" asks one intrepid warrior.  "We have won the greatest of victories, and most of it can be laid at your feet?  Why are you not celebrating?""So many have gone before," you whisper forcefully, tears in your eyes.  "We have indeed won, but I am the First Thurokiir, charged with protecting the Auroran people, and how many have I used up in attaining my goal?  A penance must be paid, and it must be paid by me."With that, you walk away from the awestruck young warriors, and you take out your laser tattooer, and tattoo your eyelids black, so that for the rest of your life, you can see some of the darkness of death you have inflicted on those whom you were tasked to protect...Your ears are still ringing from the firepower you just witnessed on the way in."That's the reality of the front-lines between the Federation and the Auroran Empire," Barry grimaces.  "It's been this bad or worse for as long as I've been travelling the spaceways.  This is one of the systems where they clash.  You see, south of this system you are in Auroran space, and they are a completely different people to us Federation folk.  I don't completely buy into the propaganda you hear about them from the government, but they are definitely a savage race.  They seem to delight in battle, and they seem to spend at least as much time fighting amongst themselves as they do fighting against us up here in the Federation.  I personally haven't spent too much time in Auroran space, I didn't like the attitude I got from their 'warriors'.  They treated me like I was a second-class citizen because I wasn't one of them.  Still, if you deal fair with them, they seem to be prepared to deal fairly in return."Some distance to the east of the Kania system," he continues quietly, "you then have the Polaris.  Don't know much about them, but then nobody does.  They don't seem to want to mix with us, and they seem hell-bent on not allowing us to mix with them.  And let's face it, when they are centuries ahead of us technologically, if they want to be left alone, then I'm all for leaving them alone, it saves everyone a whole bucket-load of hassles.""You realize that your passengers are all members of the mysterious Polaris civilization, and although you want to ask many questions of them, the casual stares of the two men in gray keep your curiosity in check.As soon as you land Bis Andreya is greeted by a man garbed in an all-green outfit who lays his hands on the head of the elderly woman.  After a few short moments he nods his head and allows Bis Andreya to step off your ramp."By now you know that we are of the Polaris," says the elderly woman over her shoulder at you, "but you may not know the enormity of your actions over the last few days.  To help you understand, know that my full name is only Andreya.  Bis is the title given to the leader of the Polaris Ruling Council."After a few moments the enormity of her words begins to sink in.  You have just saved the leader of the Polaris from being detained by the Federation.  And you begin to ask several questions, like: 'why was the Federation, given Bis Andreya's position, trying to detain her?'You realize that your passengers are all members of the mysterious Polaris civilization, and although you want ask many questions of them, the casual stares of the two men in gray keep your curiosity in check.As soon as you land Bis Andreya is greeted by a man garbed in an all-green outfit who lays his hands on the head of the elderly woman.  After a few short moments he nods his head and allows Bis Andreya to step off your ramp and she turns to face you.You shift uncomfortably under her piercing gaze."You were offered 20,000 credits for your services," Bis Andreya continues, "but I will make sure that you receive five times that amount in thanks for your deeds.  I will also allow you access to the docking computers where my people lodge their travel requirements.  You will be the first non-Polaran ever to be allowed to ferry my people from place to place."With that Bis Andreya, the green cloaked man and the two men in gray turn and walk away, seemingly in unison."Perhaps I will see you again some day," Mu'Randa murmurs as she too exits your ship and walks away leaving behind numerous unspoken questions unanswered.vAs soon as you land your ship is overrun by the blue-robed scientists who pay you and your ship scant regard.  In irritation you throw them all off your ship, telling them that the ship comes first, and that their data can wait a few more minutes.  Many of them look very ashamed as you pointedly upbraid them about their poor manners.  Out of the corner of your eye you think you catch a gray-cloaked warrior smile slightly, but when you turn in her direction her face is without expression."Please accept my sincerest apology," says P'Jeena, stepping forward.  "We meant no disrespect, our only excuse is an eagerness to view the data held in the holo-scanner.  We are sorry for any inconvenience we caused."You nod and tell him that when you have finished your post-flight routine you will allow them full access to your ship, but not before.As soon as she is allowed, Mu'Randa hurries off your ship to meet the leaders of the Polaris people.  When you notice that there only seem to be four non-brown garbed people present, with Mu'Randa being the fifth, you start to get suspicious about her position within the Mu'hari.  When <SN> is introduced to everybody present and Mu'Randa is introduced as the Mu'hari caste-leader your suspicions are confirmed.In person the Wraith is an awesome being to look at.  Standing taller than many ships, and speaking in its clipped Polaran from the imperfect translator gives it a mysterious and powerful aura.The actual talks begin when <SN> refers to the Polaris, and the translator translates it as 'the aggressive ones'."Why do you refer to us as aggressive?" asks a member of the Ruling Council.  "We have no wish to make war upon you or your kind."The Wraith replies that nearly 100 cycles ago, two young Wraith tried to feed off a Polaris ship, and were destroyed for no reason.You are greeted by the auburn-haired Mu'Randa in what looks like her official black-robes when you land."We inducted twenty new Mu'Hari today," she explains almost sadly when she sees you eyeing her robes quizzically.  "Now they too must begin to try to wipe aside our shame."You eye her askance, wondering what could cause such a happy, ebullient person to become so melancholy."The Mu'hari caste is the most shameful of castes," she tells you in response to your unspoken question.  "We were born as a result of a civil war, we enter our caste because we cannot make it into any other, we must serve all other Polaris wherever we can, but we have the overwhelming duty of standing in judgement over our fellow citizens if necessary.  We are the faithless servants who must betray our masters for a perceived greater good.  That is why we wear black, as a mark of our shame and to remind us that despite any powers we might have, we are not worthy to call ourselves Polarans."*As soon as you exit your ship, General Smart steps forward and introduces himself and the rest of the Rebel leaders alongside him.  You suddenly remember where you have seen him before, recalling back to the early days of the last Auroran War when the Federation was getting massacred due to the incompetence of its military leadership.  It was only when General Smart took over the reins that the tide turned, and with some brilliant leadership he saved the Federation from a potentially cataclysmic defeat.You are equally impressed by the men he introduces as the rest of the Rebel leadership.  In short order you have shaken hands with Mr. Donald Chick, the former head of Sigma Shipyards - the largest corporation in Known Space; Professor Barri Williams, former Vice-Chancellor and lecturer in political history at the prestigious Kane University; Cardinal Vardy de Valera, the Monseigneur for Theological Studies in the Church of Krim-Hwa; and Dr. Oriallo Pentecost, a former Federation Councillor representing Port Kane.You are met by Bis Andreya and the leaders of the four other castes."Are they a danger?" asks Iuso without preamble in the musical Polaris tongue which you are starting to get used to."I don't believe so," Mu'Randa replies in a slightly deferential tone, "but they may have revealed to us something else that is.""And just what is this other hazard?" asks Bis Andreya after looking at the leader of the warrior caste in rebuke for his lack of protocol in speaking first.  He looks slightly chastened."The Federation," Mu'Randa answers in the same deferential tone, "or more specifically, the 'Bureau of Internal Investigation' which, according to the Rebels, have taken over executive power within the Federation.  In fact they told us in no uncertain terms that they were not rebelling against the Federation, but against this Bureau specifically.""And you believe them?" asks Bis Andreya with slightly narrowed eyes.Mu'Randa nods.Over the course of the flight you get to know Mu'Evlin quite well, learning a lot about his life and the Mu'hari in general.  He tells you that the word 'Mu'hari' literally translates as 'servants of all,' but that the Mu'hari themselves think of it as meaning 'casteless,' as they are the 'casteless caste.'  You learn that Mu'Evlin originally trained as a Ver'ash in his youth, but failed the final tests to become a fully-fledged member, and so began his training as a Mu'hari.You are very surprised to hear that it took him slightly more than five decades to complete the training to finally become a Mu'hari, but when he tells you that he had to train to be conversant in physics, chemistry, laboring, engineering, biology, medicine, all forms of trade, mathematics, soldiery, mechanics, police-work, intelligence and counter intelligence, law, diplomacy and all forms of combat, you begin to realize why.  But no Mu'hari ever goes on to master any particular discipline.As soon as you land, you head back to help the slightly disorganized Mu'Yana to get ready to infiltrate the Federation.  To your surprise, when you reach her room you see her all packed up and dressed in common Federation clothing, ready to go."Once I reach a terminal," she tells you with a smile, "I will authorize some money to be transferred into your account; it is the least I can do to repay you for all your help.  No outsider has ever done so much for our nation, and very few Polarans have ever done so either."A lot of people have been questioning whether Mu'Randa made the right decision," Mu'Yana continues with a small shrewd smile on her face, "when she called you 'Ory'hara', I must admit that I was one of them.  But now that I have seen you in person, I can see that she may very well have made the right call.  Still, there is much to be done before you can prove yourself worthy of that name, but you may just be able to do it."!On your long journey to <RST> you get plenty of chances to talk to Mu'Dren.  You learn that he is one of the oldest serving Mu'hari alive, at 185 years of age, and that he has been a full Mu'hari for over a century.  He tells you a lot about some of the things he has done in his lifetime.  You are impressed by the absolute selflessness of his existence, and you tell him so."It is not enough," he tells you, his intense gray eyes growing sad, "my shame is still yet unpaid."You press him a number of times to tell you more about being called 'Ory'hara', but each time he gently puts you off.  Finally, in disgust, you give up and ask him instead about his comments regarding the 'art of prophecy' and the Vell-os."Many Polaris are telepaths - I am one, as is Mu'Randa," he explains quietly, "although none of us could ever rival the Vell-os in power or skill.  Some telepaths are actually capable of looking into the future, although it is still misty and a little vague.  This what we call the art of prophecy."{b818 "As soon as you land you head over to Eamon's office and enter to see him stripped to the waist, showing off all his tattoos, dealing out a beating to four young men in Wild Geese uniforms on a large square padded mat.  The ease with which he is humbling highly-trained soldiers speaks volumes for his skills." "As soon as you land you head straight to the dockmaster's office to ask about where you might find Flannigan.  You are surprised to be told detailed instructions on how to find his office without even being asked why.  As you head off to follow the directions given, you cannot help wondering about such lax security surrounding the leader of a military force.Your questions are answered when you reach his office and enter to see a man wearing the savage tattoos of an Auroran warrior dealing out a beating to four young men in Wild Geese uniforms on a large square padded mat.  The ease with which he is humbling highly-trained soldiers speaks volumes for his personal level of security."}As soon as you enter he calls a stop to the proceedings and tells his young students to take a fifteen minute break before coming over and shaking your hand."{b818 "Greetings, Knight of the Red Branch" "I'm Eamon Flannigan"}," he {b818 "says warmly in his" "introduces himself in an"} impossibly deep voice{b818 ".  \"I had a suspicion that you were" ", \"and you must be"} this 'Ory'hara' Mu'Randa keeps telling me about.  Care to join me on the mat?"During the long journey from New Ireland to <RST> you while away the hours doing the exercises and practicing the techniques taught to you by Eamon.  Within a week you notice a definite improvement in your power and your speed.  Day by day you find it easier to focus on the patterns that surround everything around you.  By the end of your journey you can open your mind to the spiritual realm at will with only a few seconds of concentration.  Never in your life have you felt more alive.As you pilot your way down to the surface as you have done on thousands of worlds before, you decide that if you ever get the chance, you will follow Eamon's advice and train with the Nil'kemorya.  If anyone can teach you more about the skills you have only just begun to learn, it would be them.  Now that your mind has been opened you want to explore much further into this new universe that has been shown to you. It turns out that Mu'Feren spent the early years of her life training as a Nil'kemorya, and that therefore she is one of the most accomplished warriors within the Mu'hari.  So early on in the voyage you ask her if she could continue the training started by Eamon Flannigan.Day after day in hyperspace she pushes your body and your mind to new limits, revelling at how quickly you learn.  Within days you learn to fall into observing the 'weaves of life', as she calls it, without any effort at all.  A few days more, and you realize that you find the more 'normal' forms of observation (sight, sound, etc) more taxing to use than this level of spiritual awareness, which has become very relaxing.  By the end of your voyage, you have even crudely affected the weaves around you to create, in effect, your own weaves.Not once in the time you spent with her did you even come close to even matching Mu'Feren's skill, but in the few weeks you have spent under her tuition you know that you made enormous leaps forward. Upon landing you are given a semi-official welcome by Dr. Pentecost and General Smart."Welcome back, Ory'hara," begins Dr. Pentecost formally.  "We apologize for the lack of ceremony, but we were only made aware of your approach when our sensors picked you up entering this system."You wave away his apology, telling him that it does not matter."Would you care to accompany us to a more private place to talk?" asks General Smart, taking over, and you nod and ask him to lead on.  The three of you make your way to an empty office above that of the dockmaster."So how can we help you?" asks Dr. Pentecost after you all sit down.You quickly explain that the Polaris have managed to verify many of the claims that they had made against the Bureau, after a great deal of searching inside Federation space."The Bureau certainly knows how to go about hiding its dirty laundry," General Smart nods in acknowledgment of the difficulty in investigating the Bureau.  "But that still doesn't explain why you're here."As soon as you land you are met by a gray-cloaked Nil'kemorya named Drengar, who takes you to the Arando's mountain retreat.  You learn that he is one of Arando's students, and you are soon introduced to Arando himself."I have heard much about you, Ory'hara," rumbles the surprisingly small Arando, looking you over with his faded brown-gray eyes.  "I am greatly honored that you have thought me worthy to teach you.  I will work hard to live up to that honor."Over the following months, you learn that this man is a master among masters.  All of his students are all well on their way to becoming masters in their own right, and at the start you are hopelessly outclassed by all of them.As the days turn into weeks, and the weeks into months, you can see the constant effects of the physical and mental training start to pay off.  Soon you are picking up on the weaves of some of Arando's students before they themselves do, and in no time you are beginning to hold your own.This time during the battle you became more involved in the ebb and flow of the battle than you ever have before, but somehow you retained control.  Whereas before you seemed to lose all sense of self and started to become one with the fabric of the universe, this time it almost seemed like the fabric of the universe became one with you.In fact, just once, towards the end of the battle, you were able to see the link between the weaves of life and the universe itself.  Only your cautious nature stopped you from using that link, as the power available to you at that moment was truly terrible.  You almost frighten yourself with the thought that the universe could have been one with your will, but somehow the idea feels right and natural.You shake yourself out of your reverie as you guide your ship into the docking bay.  You smile a small empty smile when you sense the familiar presence of Master Arando awaiting you.You spend the days in hyperspace training with both Drengar and Mu'Sentan, who both seem eager to learn from you.  You begin to realize that you are becoming something of a role-model to most Polarans, and that quite a number of them have begun to emulate you.As you pilot your beloved <PSN> into dock, you cannot help but shake your head at the idea that you should be the object of such reverence.Your reverie is interrupted when you sense the weaves of ten very hostile men waiting for you outside your ship.  Both you and Drengar exchange glances and immediately head for the hatch.You both step out to see ten fiercely tattooed Auroran warriors who immediately spring to attack.  You are almost surprised at how little effort you have to spend in stepping between their weaves and upsetting their attack plan.  In a few short graceful seconds you remain standing in a pool of blood with eight dead bodies lying around you.
Once again you spend your time in hyperspace teaching both Drengar and Mu'Sentan more about their warrior arts.  You find that the more you work with them, the easier it is for you to merge the universe with your mind and make it work to your will.  Both of your students are awestruck when your reveal to them that the 'lucky' weaves that seem to spring up of their own accord around you were really of your creation.Once again you sense a hostile reception awaiting for you when you land, and both you and Drengar head to the hatch to once again prove yourselves to the Aurorans.Outside you are met with ten young warriors who immediately launch themselves at you, revealing their mastery of combat by throwing extremely complex weaves at you in an almost incomprehensible pattern.  Without thinking, you immediately merge with the universe, and after a few moments of graceful violence, nine of these men lay dead at your feet, with Drengar standing over the tenth, shaking his head in awe.!Once again, after many long days of training in hyperspace, you sense a hostile reception as you maneuver your way into dock.  As you and Drengar make your way out of the hatch you are slightly surprised to see a single man, bare to the waist, with a stylized bird tattooed on his face and hundreds of other small tattoos covering his body waiting for you.  Your surprise evaporates when you sense the complexity of his weaves.  The only time you have seen weaves like it were when you were in the presence of Master Arando."I cannot defeat this man," states Drengar quietly, and you nod, indicating that he should remain onboard the ship.You step out of the hatch and merge with the universe, sensing the patterns of your opponent's weaves around you.  In a surprise move he attacks with deadly skill.  You are forced to draw upon all of your abilities to twist his weaves back on him again and again, slowly forcing him to lose ground until with a single movement of almost poetic power, you knock him unconscious.You sense the bubbly spirit of Mu'Randa even before you land, and she greets you with her vivacious smile when you exit your ship."It is good to see you again, Ory'hara," she exclaims, smiling.  "How did things go in Auroran space?"As the two of you walk along you give her a rough outline of the events of the journey, skipping over the details of the various fights you had a part in before concluding with the message from Mu'Sentan.  After you finish, she stops and looks at you thoughtfully."Modesty definitely becomes you, Ory'hara, but don't think I haven't heard reports of your deeds," she tells you after a long pause.  "It seems that you have reached a level that only the Vell-os of old could have even dreamed of.  Arando openly acknowledges you as a Master now, and he doesn't do that lightly.  Both he and some of his fellow masters have all reported feeling the fabric of the universe change every time you do whatever it is you are able to do."During the journey Mu'Randa asks you a number of questions regarding your abilities and your confrontation with the Krypt.  You end up training with her, and guiding her to a greater understanding of her own arts and abilities.When you land you are greeted by a green-robed woman whom Mu'Randa introduces as Ver'Lahir.  She indicates that you should all follow her and she leads you into an observation booth looking down into a laboratory.  Beneath you, you see a man lying down with a complex device fitted to the base of his skull surrounded by ten sweating Polarans of varying classes.  Observing closer you sense that the surrounding people are all very strong telepaths and they are trying to somehow 'lift' some kind of 'weight' away from the mind of the prone patient.  Suddenly you understand that the Polaris are trying to find a way of temporarily 'taking the strain' away from the prone man who is 'enslaved' by the device attached to his skull.As soon as you land your passenger is wheeled out into one of the many medical facilities on the station.  Mu'Randa watches the other Polaris wheel him away before coming over and placing a hand on your shoulder."You couldn't have known," she informs you quietly, "but Llyrell, the Vell-os you fought, was known throughout the galaxy as perhaps the greatest master of the Vell-os arts in a millennia, possibly the greatest ever.  To have defeated one such as him proves that you are Ory'hara.  Nobody else could have achieved it."You look up into her kind blue eyes, your mind still reeling from being as one with the universe.  You can feel the soft razor's edge of insanity dwelling not far away, even as you go over the events in your mind."You will be happy to know," Mu'Randa continues happily, ignorant of your distress.  "That the Bureau is in disarray after the Rebel attack on their headquarters, and all the subsequent drama."You find yourself getting mildly irritated when you sense a number of young Auroran warriors eagerly awaiting your arrival so that they can test themselves against you.  As soon as you open the hatch you slip into the universe and create weaves so dense that they are powerful enough to throw grown men around like leaves.  As you hold all ten young warriors motionless in mid-air you tell them in no uncertain terms that you are in no mood to deal with their silliness today.  Only when you are certain that they understand you do you relent and lower them back down to the ground.You ask one of the now slightly frightened youngsters where you have to go to talk with the Elders of their House and he points without hesitation to a stairwell off to the side of the docking facility going up.  You nod in thanks and begin making your way to them.After a long climb the stairs open out into a large room in which a number of elderly looking warriors are seated around a large table talking in an orderly fashion.As soon as you land you are met by a small battle group of warriors obviously prepared to repel any sneak attack by Moash warriors.  As soon as they see you they quickly back off, giving you a respectful amount of space."I see that young Dechtakar warriors aren't the only group of people you have frightened into leaving you alone," Du'Nakh chuckles.  "Although, I can imagine that the eagerness with which young warriors these days try to gain renown could quickly become very tiresome for one of your abilities."When you reach the council chambers you gain the attention of every person in the room with a subtle weave."Have you seen something of interest to the Ruling Council?" asks Techerakh a little obliquely."What I have seen is a First Family that has treacherously and dishonorably allied itself with our most hated enemies," Du'Nakh confirms grimly, "in a greedy attempt to gain nothing more than mere power."Upon landing the three of you make your way to the chambers of the Ruling Council.  As you walk up to the door that opens into the chambers themselves, you sense the hostile intentions of twenty young warriors who leap out at the three of you in an ambush.  Having long since merged with the universe, you launch into a series of brutally graceful moves that end with the bloody deaths of all your attackers.You quickly put together weaves thick enough to lift the remains and you mentally will the door open, calmly walking in and dumping the bodies at the feet of the three Moash representatives and the Emperor, who all look momentarily shaken."What is the meaning of this?" blusters the Emperor through his surprise."It is another proof of the level to which the Moash House has sunk," replies Du'Nakh stonily.  "My word is as law, and I have seen with my own eyes the ships of our most hated enemy, the Bureau, in your own home system, where, alongside your own ships, they attacked us."As you meditate to pass the time in your many hours in hyperspace, you start to occasionally feel a desire to completely merge with the universe.  As you have only completely immersed yourself into the universe once, and were nearly driven insane by it, you resist the temptation, but you cannot help feeling that it will not be long before you are forced to do it again.As you dock on the enormous ring around <RST>, you sense that the entire Council is waiting to greet you, and you suddenly understand that even these ancient and wise men and women have begun to succumb to the awe surrounding the mystique of your skills.Never before have you taken so long to complete your post-flight routine.  You do everything you can think of to put off having to face people who are so impressed by your abilities that they can no longer recognize your humanity.  But you can only avoid it for so long, and soon you are ready to exit your ship.Before you even land you can sense the faded remnants of the Krypt-tokh's psychic aura as you absent-mindedly pilot your ship down through Korell's atmosphere.  From the residue they left behind you deduce that they partially embedded their minds into their nanites in an effort to escape detection by the ravaging forces of the Colonial Council.  With a sudden whiff of inspiration you realize that they actually created the Krypt in an effort to defend this world, and eventually all of what was Vell-os space whilst they waited for the spirit of the universe to awaken and return them to their natural state.Suddenly you know what has to be done, and you weave an invitation to the Krypt into your defenses against her attacks which suddenly stop, and you can sense her focusing her intellect into the grotto where you feel the remnants of the Krypt-tokh.With a subtle inclination of your head, you tell Lyrell to follow you as you head in that direction.You sense the presence of the entire Polaris Ruling Council plus the caste leaders awaiting your arrival.  Without digging too deep you can feel the irritation of the caste-leaders and the anxiety of the council members.Stepping out of the hatch, you are almost horrified to see everyone bowing.  Without thought you weave them all upright, telling them that you are still just a {g"man" "woman"}."It took us over six centuries," intones Bis Andreya formally, "but, with your help, we have finally been able to pay our debt to the Vell-os."But we have another problem," she continues, and you can sense her nervousness.  "You may not be aware that we have recently entered into secret alliances with both the Federation and the Auroran Empire.  The reasoning was that we could use our new position as allies to bring to bear some leverage on both parties in order to bring them closer together."Unfortunately," she tells you, her voice on the verge of breaking, "things didn't go quite as planned."As soon as you land your ship is overrun by the green-robed engineers and their blue-robed colleagues who pay you and your ship scant regard.  In irritation you throw them all off your ship, telling them that the ship comes first, and that their data can wait a few more minutes.  Many of them look very ashamed as you pointedly upbraid them about their poor manners.  Out of the corner of your eye you think you catch a gray-cloaked warrior smile slightly, but when you turn in her direction her face is without expression."Please accept my sincerest apology," says P'Jeena, stepping forward.  "We meant no disrespect, our only excuse is an eagerness to view the data held in the holo-scanner.  We are sorry for any inconvenience we caused."You nod and tell him that when you have finished your post-flight routine you will allow them full access to your ship, but not before.After landing you take a few moments to enjoy your last minutes of mortality before you begin to slip into the seductive embrace of the universe, and you turn your attention to the unfolding events of the galaxy.You watch as the remnants of the Nil'kemorya limp back to Kel'ar Iy, and watch as both their Federation and Auroran prisoners are released.  You watch the sad drama unfold as Bis Andreya surrenders her nation to both of them jointly.  You almost chuckle when you realize that only Techerakh understands the gesture."They have destroyed our ability to make war," he explains to others.  "To make peace, and bring us together, they have surrendered to both governments.  We will now have to work side-by-side to manage the dismantling of their government as they will not accept the ruling of one government alone."With a sigh, you smile sadly and let yourself go.  As your consciousness dissipates and you lose yourself in the enormous depths of the universe, in one final act you weave into existence a memorial to your acts as Ory'hara, to remind future generations that you will one day return when you are once again needed.Every spare moment you have on the long journey back to meet P'Jeena you spend meditating and training to see if you could better survive another such attack.  Never before have you felt such an enormously powerful force try to unravel your mind.  The more you study the incident, the more frightened you become.  Even the smallest moment of hesitation at any time would have left you dead in an instant.Day after day you practice in an attempt to duplicate Krypt's weaves in order to better understand her attack and be better prepared for any future encounter you may have with her.  Towards the end of your journey you begin to figure out how to produce the same configurations of weaves she did, but you are still a long way from being able to create them with anywhere near the same rapidity.As you fly down through the polluted atmosphere of P'ar Aed you vow to keep meditating on her weaves and keep practicing so as not to have to struggle so desperately the next time you meet her.GAfter going through you post-flight routine you head off to find the campus of the Kane University.  After a little over an hour of searching you find it.  Another hour and you are standing in the Center for Vell-os Studies wondering what to do next.As you look around, you sense the currents move around you in a strange way, somehow indicating a mind more in touch with the weaves of life than your own and you turn to see the traditional long hair and fair limbs of a Vell-os striding down the corridor towards you.  He suddenly looks at you curiously."Welcome, Ory'hara," he greets you almost reverently, "we have been waiting for your arrival for many years."You nod your head in recognition of your greeting, trying to mask the slightly confusing whirl of questions going through your mind.After going through you post-flight routine you head off to find the campus of the Kane University.

You turn and see the traditional long hair and fair limbs of the very same Vell-os man who directed you towards Auroran space all that time ago striding down the corridor towards you.  He suddenly looks at you curiously."It is good to see you again, Ory'hara," he greets you almost reverently.  "When I first met you, I thought you might be the one, but now that I have seen you again I am certain..."You nod your head in recognition of your greeting, trying to mask the slightly confusing whirl of questions going through your mind.You are met by a solemn Llyrell when you land."I am truly sorry, <PN>," he tells you in the face of your anger.  "But I too am a slave, and one of the many rules we must abide by is to report all potential telepaths.  But for you there is some hope.  You aren't Vell-os; there is a small chance that one day you may earn your freedom.  In the meantime we must endure our servitude together."Now," he says, "if you are to be enslaved, you may as well learn a little about your capabilities."Suddenly you feel a warm pressure in the back of your mind."Can you feel that?" asks Llyrell, and you nod.<good>You look around, trying to find out who spoke.  You turn to see Llyrell looking at you intently.  You realize that he is speaking directly into your head.<not quite i am manipulating your surface thoughts so that you think the words i want to say to you>[As soon as you open the hatch you are hailed by a smiling Jay walking along the concourse towards you."I take it you got it," he states with a grin and a wink, and you can sense his relief.  You realize that the rebels in this system must be living under terrible restrictions to survive the enormous Federation blockade of their world.After you show him your holds he claps you on the shoulder."Come with me to my office," he says, "and we'll see what can be done about payment and a regular run.  We'll leave the unloading to the people who get paid for it."As soon as you open the hatch you are hailed by a smiling Jay walking along the concourse towards you."I take it you got what we wanted," he states with a grin and a wink, and once again you can sense the genuine relief at seeing you again.  The rebels on this planet must really be struggling.To satisfy his curiosity, you bring him aboard and show him your holds and he claps you on the shoulder."Excellent work!" he says.  "Come with me to my office, and we'll see what can be done about payment and another regular run.  There are enough people around here who get paid to do the unloading, so why don't we leave them to it."Your passenger thanks you for helping him out as he leaves, but you cannot help but wish that you had never met the man.  You wonder what he will end up doing to these brave rebels in the name of the Bureau.You look over to see the muscular figure of Jay walking towards you."Good work," he states cheerfully.  "Come to my office, I have credit chip with your name on it."}As soon as you land you are escorted by Bureau soldiers to the meet the Moash House elders.  You do not have to use your telepathic abilities to see that they are unhappy to be surrounded by heavily armed guards.You sit down at the head of the table and quickly outline the terms of Krane's proposal.  When you finish they stir, looking a little excited.  You allow them to confer amongst themselves quietly for a few minutes until they turn back to you."How can we trust you and your masters?" asks the eldest-looking warrior of the group.You shake your head and say that they can either have faith or be destroyed.  But you go on to say that the Bureau will only betray organizations that are no longer useful to them and you explain that the Bureau has no wish to be tied down by the duties of direct rule, it prefers to operate behind the scenes.$As soon as you land you are greeted by a savagely tattooed Moash warrior who leaps at you in an effort to rip your throat out.  You react by weaving the pattern of a Spring Flower as Llyrell taught you, but you mistakenly force too much energy into it in your excitement.  In an effort to keep the energy under control you are forced to weave in a calming effect.  You notice as you do that it almost resembles the warmth of the sun on your spring flower.You step over the remains of the warrior and quickly head up to the Moash council chambers and hand over the message pod to the old warrior at the head of the table and step back.  He manages to fumble his way through opening it without making any major mistakes and begins to scan the contents.  After a few minutes he looks up and thanks you for your delivery.As you walk back to the spacedock you continually go over the fight in your mind, memorizing your actions.  With a little practice, you think that you should be able to duplicate the effect at any time.As you pilot your way to your destination, you find yourself exploring the nature of the device attached to the nape of your neck.  After several days you learn that it works by influencing the part of your brain that controls repetitive actions or actions that have become second-nature.  The end result is that you realize that if you become skilled enough, you could simply bypass this portion of your brain, and you would be free to remove the device.  You find yourself wondering how the device works on T1's like Llyrell who are more than skilled enough to do exactly this.Upon landing, you hand over the message pod to the same old warrior as last time and watch him open it.  After taking a few minutes to scan the contents he turns to you and thanks you for your services.After returning back to the landing pad, you quickly reform your protective shell and launch yourself into space.  You find yourself becoming excited at the thought that one day you might be free.As you pilot your way down through the atmosphere you can sense the mind of the soldier who is your normal contact to Krane waiting for you at the edge of the spacedocks."Well?" he asks calmly after you dissolve your protective barrier, but despite his easy manner you can sense that he is more than a little worried by what you might say.You nod, and confirm the Bureau's suspicions that the woman in question is Mu'hari, adding that she is a skilled telepath."Did she know she was getting probed?" asks the soldier, his eyes widening slightly.  You shake your head, but add that it was a near thing in the hope that he might decide that it is a little too risky to try to capture the Mu'hari.As soon as you land, you are staggered by several thousand minds attacking you at once as all the telepaths amongst the Polaris attack you in a desperate attempt to protect their home planet.  None of their attacks is anywhere near enough to destroy you, but the sheer volume nearly overwhelms you.In desperation you begin to twist their attacks away in groups out into space, but it is not enough.  It seems like an eternity, but after a titanic battle of around fifteen seconds they break through all your barriers and stab into your mind.In a moment of sheer panic, you try to expel all the energy coming into your mind in a single powerful burst which you control by adding weaves of storm clouds around the 'summer bloom' weaves.  You realize in the back of your mind that you have managed to create the devastating 'winter tempest' attack.Suddenly you understand that if you use the energy that the Polaris telepaths are pumping into you, you are in absolutely no danger of being overwhelmed.$You can sense the mighty intelligence that is the Krypt-mind focus its awareness not far from where you are landing.  As you wait inside your protective barrier it approaches and you allow it to enter whereupon an obsidian figure of a naked woman steps into the interior of your javelin.<you wish to know how to free the vell-os i can help you they have been ready to evolve beyond this universe for more than a millennia but have been waiting for the right conditions i was created when the six [krypt-tokh/battle-leaders] imbued their minds into their nanites at the end of the vell-os war to evade capture i have grown since then but i still retain the capacity to act as six t1s unfortunately the vell-os will require seven t1s to sufficiently focus enough energy to allow a single t0 to weld together their entire racial memory into one mind with enough power to move on>You halt her flow of information with a single question: <one-mind><t1s can focus telepathic energy a t0 could achieve true telepathic union>As soon as you land you attack the waiting Bureau personnel, frying them instantaneously.  Non-telepaths cannot stand against even the simplest of telepathic attacks without heavy shielding, and not even the heaviest shielding can stand for long against the terrible destructiveness of the 'winter tempest'.  In minutes you have cut your way through the Bureau building, destroying everything in your path.  You finally reach the inner sanctum, where you are confronted by a calm-looking Llyrell and a frightened Krane."Attack {G"him" "her"} now!" she yells fearfully."I cannot defeat {G"him" "her"}," Llyrell replies."Then get the energy from the rest of you to join!" she spits out vilely."It still might not work," he answers evasively, "it depends on how skilled {G"he" "she"} has become.""We have no choice!" she screams.  "DO IT!"He shrugs and gathers the mental energy of his entire race, launching it at you.  In desperation you react by twisting the energy around the minds of the entire Vell-os race.  Suddenly the weaves seem to coalesce and you can feel your consciousness expanding and being joined by thousands of others, all thinking as one, and then everything goes black.iAs soon as you land, Llyrell forges together all the mental energy of the Vell-os race and launches it at the Krypt-mind who quickly weaves a complex pattern around it before extending it to you in an incredibly focused beam of pure energy.  It only takes you a few moments to repeat the weaves you made on New England, this time including Krypt, and once again everything goes dark.***Prime awakens, vaster than before.  Prime watches the universe unfold into infinity.  The possibilities become limitless.  Prime tenses, ready to launch past everything that is into everything that will be.  There is a sudden tickle.  Prime reaches back and moves a few minor pieces and feels the game change.  Prime smiles as the harm is wiped away.Prime turns back to what will be and leaps forward to greet the others already awaiting there.Upon arrival you are greeted by an {G"attractive" "slim young"} woman with {G"lustrous" "long"} red hair wearing the blue-black uniform of a United Shipping official."Hi, I'm Jennifer Deally," she shakes your hand with a smile.  "I can't tell you how good it is to see someone from outside this blasted warrior culture."Anyway," she continues quickly, "I'd better show you how to make your deliveries so that you don't risk offending someone.  Disagreements around here are usually solved with blades, so it would probably be best to avoid that."You nod in complete agreement and follow her as she continues her charming banter.  Before long you enter a long low warehouse stacked with wall to wall crates.As you pilot your way down through <RST>'s atmosphere you can sense Fllyraen waiting for you.  When you land he looks into your eyes for a long moment, and you can feel him observing your mind.<it is time you learned of our history>With that he bombards you with images of the Vell-os race from its humble beginnings when all the telepaths left Earth nearly 3000 years ago, when something known as the 'Spanish Inquisition' threatened to destroy them all.  They left under the Indian Prince Vell-os and they travelled the galaxy for many centuries before finally settling on the planet Vellos.You see them develop their abilities and watch their civilization grow.  You see their biotechnology evolve until the day when they begin growing nanite producing organs to help protect them against disease and the effects of aging.  To this day, other than the mental powers, this is the single biggest difference between the Vell-os and their human cousins.  You find yourself trying to remember how to duplicate some of their skills, but the array thrown at you in so short a time dazzles you, and only a couple stick in your mind.You find Fllyraen waiting for you alongside an officious-looking Bureau agent.<come he wishes to talk more privately>You follow Fllyraen and he leads you and the Bureau agent into a private room."<PN>," begins the agent formally, "these are the standing orders given to all telepaths under our control, and you will obey them all, without fail.  Understand?"You nod, and the agent nods at Fllyraen."The first rule," Fllyraen verbalizes impassively, "is that you must obey orders only from Bureau personnel, and those orders must be weighed according to the rank of the person giving the order, ie if you get two conflicting sets of orders, you will follow the orders of the person with the highest rank within the Bureau."The second rule," he continues quietly, "is that you must report any person or persons who harbor ill-intent towards the Bureau of Internal Investigation immediately to the nearest Bureau agent."Rebel cargo handlers begin to unload the crates from your hold, while rebel tacticians begin downloading your sensor banks for study.  You are more than happy to let them, since it will lend some credence to the stories you are going to have to tell during your debriefing.  The cannons are stupendous in battle.  You cannot wait to let the rebels loose with them.  The Federation will never know what hit them.CYou watch as the dock workers unload the alloy from your hold, and as you do, you tell Olaf about what happened on <DST>.  He smiles, telling you that it was always important to treat workers well, as all management did was use fancy words for what the workers did.  He wanders off to organize the alloy delivery, and you can't help but smile at the means and ways that Olaf got what he wanted.  Never with violence, but with just as good results.  In fact with better results.  You never have to brandish a gun if the other person likes you.(The scene at the hatch is amazing to behold, as a family is reunited.  It reminds you of why you attempt the crazy things you do.  Olaf heads over to you, clasping your hand, and the two of you head off for a drink, happy to leave the Sutherlands to catch up.As soon as you land near the main complex the colonists exit to begin the registration process of starting on a new world.  You wish them all the best of luck and shake the hand of every one.  You cannot help but admire their pioneering spirit.Once you have finished unloading the colonists you head over to what is left of the buildings where David and his team resided during the years they were terraforming this planet."Captain <PN>!" booms David when you walk in.  "What do you think of our slice of paradise?"You reply that you are amazed and stunned at the achievements made by him and his fellow scientists.kAs you pilot your way into what is normally a restricted area, out of bounds to all non-Sigma Shipyards personnel, you take a quick peek at some of the enormous shipyards at their disposal.As soon as you land dockworkers swarm all over your vessel and in no time they have unloaded your cargo.  A few minutes later, as you stand around wondering what to do, you spot Rodney coming towards you."Sorry I'm a little tardy," he apologizes sincerely, "I've just been having one of those days today.  Now that I've finally arrived, here are the details I'm sure you're dying to know."Dock-workers quickly off-load the data crystals.  You get the impression that Olaf is pretty well known around Federation docks.  You imagine it must be something to do with his work for the Sol Dock-worker's Union during the strike of '22.  Apparently Olaf was targeted by the Bureau for upholding workers rights, and most of the guys remember him with affection.The merchant captain thanks you profusely once more, and pays you 75,000 credits in thanks, before joining the rest of his crew in attempting to raise the money for a new ship.mA group of dockworkers unloads the shipment of <CT> from your cargo bay.mA group of dockworkers unloads the shipment of <CT> from your cargo bay.\An officious looking woman named Ms. Hilary Crosby-Roberts meets you as the dock workers begin to off-load the Holo Cubes.  She stares down her long, pointy nose at your dirty coveralls, and quickly pushes a non existent hair back into place in the wire-brush growth on her head.  You get the impression that Ms Crosby-Roberts doesn't come down here too often, nor anywhere where dirt might exist.  She quickly thanks you for making the delivery, and passes you a chip for 30,000 credits.  You whistle under your breath.  She must have REALLY needed those Holo Cubes.You cannot help feeling that you may as well not have bothered with all the time you spent on repairs now that the various pirates know that you handle major cargo.  Much of the entire trip back was spent hastily jumping into hyperspace to avoid any pursuing pirate ships.  You have never been happier to set down in your life.The Federation Navy cargo handlers whistle under their breaths at the extent of the laser scarring and armor damage.  To say that you are glad to be rid of this 'secret' cargo would be an understatement.  It feels as if every pirate in the Universe has been trying to kill you, and all for the crates that are being unloaded.  You don't even know what's in them.You checked for other ships as soon as you entered the system, finding nothing active.  The only thing your sweep revealed was the ancient hulk of an Auroran Cruiser drifting in the distance, and because your sensors could not get a good reading on it, you diligently kept well clear of it."We're ready to activate the probe as soon as we unload it and set it up, <PN>," Jerry says as soon as you land.  You waste no time, opening the aft hatches and getting stuck into the hard work of unloading the heavy probe.As you look on, the scientists run a pre-boost check and throw the switch.  An old style ion drive lights up, and the probe starts heads up into the unknown."It'll take a long time to return any useful data, but perhaps, in a couple of hundred years, we will find the first of a new series of jumps to take us to uncharted space."  Jerry gazes wistfully at the rapidly diminishing probe.You admire his patience, and begin to set a course to take them to Sol and back to the Federation.You land on <RST> with the flush of success on your cheeks.  However, you are still surprised that the Feds attacked Shard.  You cycle the hatch and head out to find him.You meet Shard walking through the abandoned <RST> spaceport.  For the first time since you met he is smiling."Well done, <PN>." he beams "It was a hell of a fight wasn't it?"You nod, telling him that you haven't seen flying like it before."I have had some fairly specialized training," he says, "but for the moment, I'll just say that things aren't always what they appear."You look at him, bemused."I know I can trust you now, since we are in this together." he confides.  "I am not working for the Federation Government.  I'm working for a third party keen to see the artworks returned to the Vell-os."You suddenly begin to see the light; why the Feds attacked Shard, and why he has been so secretive on the whole journey."I'll meet you on your ship in twenty minutes.  I'll tell you everything there."9The wedding turns out to be a very loud and jolly affair.  The rites were solemn and beautifully written, and the sentiments of love and eternities spent together brings a tear to your eye.Michaleen's cousin, Riley Shaskeen, is so happy that you have delivered his errant cousin that he places you at the place of honor at the reception, between his unmarried and beautiful sister Sinead, and his best friend and brother Sean Shaskeen.  The night seems endless, and is full of drink and song, fights and dancing.  Men vie for the attention of the ladies, who treat them with a faintly mocking humor.  Their tongues move like whips, and you find your sides hurting from laughing at their banter.  Michaleen tries to teach you old drinking songs, and {G"Sinead" "Sean"} tries to teach you to dance.In what seems to be only a few short hours, the night is over, and you stagger away to Michaleen's place to pass into a blissful sleep full of dreams of {G"quick witted women and quicker-fisted men" "quick fisted men and quicker-witted women"}.You and Michaleen land on the Kane Band with a minimum of fuss.  It is odd that you get clearance so quickly.  You have seen waits at least ten times longer than the one you had.  Michaleen is in high spirits, and together you set off to the Impound Office to arrange for Michaleen's ship to be released.  You are nearly there when you see a group of burly figures walk out of an alley ahead of you.  They turn and wait for you to approach, and you glance over your shoulder.  More men are there, and a sudden sweat breaks out on you, as cold as the pit of your stomach.  They are all armed in some way.  Michaleen stops, and gives you an almost imperceptible nod.  The hour is late, and traffic on the walkway is thin, made up mostly of the dregs of the port's population, the night-walkers who only appear after most regular folk have gone to bed.  There is little likelihood of outside intervention, and you are forced to let the other men make the first move."Footsoldiers," Michaleen whispers from the side of his mouth, "They work for a black-hearted bastard called McGowan.  He runs a pirate organization in the Galactic North.  He has a lot of backing too, mostly from the Bureau of Internal Investigation.  Hard to prove, but still fact.  The big bastard in the middle is 'Bull' John Pennant.  He is McGowan's man in this sector, and a real piece of work too.  The only problem is I owe them money, and lots of it.  That and the fact that I bedded with Pennant's wife.  I don't like the looks of this little party."XYour landing on New Ireland sees you escorted by a squadron of Thunderheads, the fighter of choice for the Wild Geese.  As soon as you set down, an imposing figure covered in wild tattoos walks towards your hatch.  You cycle the lock and head down to meet him.  He steps aboard the <PSN> with a remarkable grace for such a large man."Hello <PN>, it is a shame we couldn't have met under happier circumstances," he says, introducing himself.  "My name in Eamon Flannigan.  I am the Commander of the Wild Geese, and Michaleen's uncle.  My sister hasn't stopped crying since your message arrived.  Michaleen must be avenged.  It was me who sent him into the nest of vipers in the first place."Flannigan's thick brogue is full of barely held emotions.  You get the impression that the man is barely able to function in his grief."Would you take me to the body?" he asks respectfully.  "I must prepare it for burial.  The practice may seem bizarre to you, but it has been the way of my people since the dawning of time, back on Sol, back before man took to the stars."You nod and take Flannigan through to the medical bay, and quietly take your leave as the man begins to grieve.  As you sit and wait, you swear to avenge Michaleen again.  It is a matter of utmost importance.Michaleen's funeral is a somber affair.  In a strange place called a cemetery, Michaleen's coffin is lowered into the ground.  A man sits and plays a strange pipe instrument, and for the first time you hear music made by something that is not electronic.  A mist rolls in, and it appears that the mourners are suspended in time, and that the moment has been frozen by some power beyond the control of man, so that it may accept the soul of the departed man with due reverence.  It is something that you will never forget, and the memory will always make you cry.You land on New Ireland with the memory of your assault on the 'South of the Border' still fresh in your mind.  You and the Wild Geese team moved through the derelict like the wraiths of death itself.  The workers tried to repulse you with small arms fire from numerous blasters, and the sentinel gun emplacements slowed you down for a while, but nothing could stop Flynn.  His heavy repeating blaster spat an unending stream of destruction, and soon enough it was time for the up close fighting.  In battle, Flynn became a wild killing machine, hacking and slashing without fear.  Men fell before him like wheat before the scythe, and many turned and tried to flee.  Flynn pulled his pistol and he and his team wreaked a bloody vengeance upon their massed ranks, and it was over in less than an hour.  You looked out of a porthole and watched the survivors flee across the icy steppes, safe in the knowledge that the extreme cold would soon end their lives.You land on Ryll to find the docks a swarm of activity.  You wonder how the corrupt dock-workers know which ships to approach, but you guess that Flannigan and the Geese have made sure that the shipping Scripts have been organized to match.A number of burly dock-workers approach you, and with a poker face you tell them that the containers are to be delivered to Marguerite Harris.  When asked by what time the goods must be delivered, you tell the foreman "Before six tomorrow, and make it snappy".  The foreman grins, and hands you a chip for 30,000 credits."There you go," he says, smiling.  "A little bonus from the boss for a prompt delivery."  You smile, more at the irony of the situation, but the dim-witted foreman does not notice the difference.You head back to your ship to get some rest and watch the news.  A couple of hours later, the broadcast you are watching is interrupted for a special report.  You watch in grim satisfaction as a news reporter makes a telecast from the front of a burning warehouse.  Great gouts of black, oily smoke billow from the building, and the Reporter has to shout to be heard over the roar of the flames.  Switching off the holo-receiver, you head for the stars and ultimately, New Ireland.You are met by a man of medium height, medium build and short, neat light brown hair.  He introduces himself as Geoff Daniels."Eamon sent word that you were coming," he begins pleasantly, "what can we do for you in your time of need?"You begin relating the recent history of the Wild Geese and their operations against McGowan and his 'guild', but Geoff holds up his hand and interrupts you."I am a member of Rebel Intelligence," he remarks with quiet humor, "I am pretty much up to date on recent galactic events.  I know of your situation and I am also fairly well aware of how you got there.  What I don't know is what you want."You have the good grace to blush, and you take a moment to compose yourself before asking him if he has any leads that you might follow to learn more about McGowan and his pirates so as to avenge some of the wrongs done against the Wild Geese and the people of New Ireland.  You add that you do not expect him to give away anything that might jeopardize the security of his network, but even the smallest hint would be appreciated.He looks at you blandly for a moment, before nodding his head slowly.
As you pilot your way down through the atmosphere you cannot help but notice a couple of deep energy-discharge craters not far from the spaceport, and you wonder what has happened here.As soon as you land Michaleen takes a deep breath to steady himself and motions you to follow him."C'mon," he mutters, looking more cowed than you would have ever believed possible, "we may as well get this over with."He leads you to a side-building off the spaceport and into what appears to be an office block.  For the commander of a mercenary unit you are surprised that this Flannigan has no personal body guards, but as you enter his office, you see him training with some other men in a side area.  As you watch you see ten men rush him, only to be repulsed by him.  He moves in a way that you have seen no other man ever move.  He weaves around them as if he controlled their movements as well as his own, and that each step taken was part of some elaborate (and painful) dance.  By the time you begin to piece together what your eyes are telling you, the man has moved on further.  It is amazing to behold.Within moments he has defeated the men.  You expect them to be smashed...broken...bloody; yet they stand, slowly for some, but they are not injured beyond possible bruises.  "Better, gentlemen, much better.  Now go and practice among yourselves.  I have business to attend to."  He turns and walks towards you.  "I can see you are impressed," Flannigan waves behind his head at the practice mat, "The skills of a mercenary are varied.  Some situations require force, others non-force.  It is something I learned during my time with the Aurorans.  The House Heraan use a specific style of Martial Arts; the Heron Style.  I am a master, but I have started teaching my men here a variation of it.  It is an amazing system."You nod in agreement, and ask what the principal basis is."In learning Heron style, you are taught to read and direct the "Weave" of combat.  Subconsciously, all of us fight to a pattern and rhythm.  Heron Style teaches us to detect it and control it.  It isn't so much that you defeat your opponent, but he defeats himself, if you force the "weave" to do so.  It is hard to explain, but once felt, and mastered, it makes all combat easier, from one on one, to mammoth battles between hundreds of ships.  There is one teacher Karlaekar, to whom the most promising students are sent.  It is said he imprints the ability to read and control the "weave" on the student subconsciously.  This makes their "weave" unreadable, and therefore very dangerous."You nod, even though most of what Flannigan has said escapes your understanding.%When you return, your bruises are nearly all healed, and most of the aches and pains are gone.  Flannigan receives the news that McGowan has accepted his proposal stoically, and mutters something about keeping an eye on the bastard to make sure he is actually abiding by his word.Within minutes word has gotten out of your bravery in meeting with McGowan, and, in typical whirlwind fashion, Michaleen has grabbed you and dragged you, only partially against your will, down to the pub.  There is much singing and dancing and before too long, you catch yourself smiling and enjoying yourself.At one point Eamon pulls you aside, and tells you that the Hacker Techs had been able to perform some last minute trickery whilst McGowan was ordering his people to return to normal activities.  For all intents and purposes, the entire Wild Rovers team are employees of the McGowan organization.  You will be receiving a regular salary from McGowan, and he will not know a thing about it."All the entries are invisible.  His accountants will never know that they are there.  Even if he gets shut down, and the proper authorities take over the operation on some of the front businesses, we'll all still keep gettin' paid."You both laugh at the irony of the situation for a long time.
When you land you are met by Flannigan, Tara Collins and the brothers Sean and Ryan O'Driscol.  You shake your head at their implied question.  After wordlessly gripping each other's arms in greeting, Tara, Sean and Ryan head off to their ships with grim faces.  You cannot help but wonder why Michaleen is not present, and you raise your eyebrows in anxious curiosity.  Flannigan shakes his head."We are in something of a fix," he begins quietly, and you chuckle at his understatement.  "The Bureau hit us hard while we were concentrating on McGowan and his damn 'guild of free traders'.  We all barely escaped alive, and the fault is partly mine.  I knew that McGowan had an agreement with the Bureau, but I didn't know they were quite this cozy.  I don't have a lot of time to explain all the ins and outs of the situation, but the end result is that I'm going to declare war on both McGowan's so-called 'guild' and on that damned Bureau.  Unfortunately for us, we have absolutely no way of winning on our own."Michaleen personally kept the Bureau's thugs bottled up in one corner of the space port for the better part of ten minutes," Flannigan says proudly, with tears in his eyes, "so that we could get everybody away.  He died well and hard."zA man wearing the shoulder pips of a Rear Admiral walks up to you and introduces himself as Rear Admiral Vessair of the Federation Navy.  He formally thanks you on behalf of the Federation for your services.  He says that there will be more missions made available to you in the area set aside for the purchase of ship outfits in the future.HYou are greeted by the <RST> Chief Supply Officer, who introduces himself as Commander Ffierra.  "Congratulations on making it through," he says, "we need every bit of help that we can get.  After having a bit of R&R, come and meet me in the ship outfitting area if you want some more work."Commander Ffierra waves as you emerge from your craft.  "Glad you could make it," he says, "I hear it got a little hairy out there a few times.  It's a good thing we've got people like you to ship this stuff around for us.  We could be in a fair amount of trouble otherwise.  Keep dropping by the outfitting area, if I've got something for you I'll get in contact with you there."As you leave your ship, you get a nod of acknowledgment from Commander Rabin.  You wander over."I hear things are getting a little rough with all the Aurorans and whatnot," he states rather tiredly.  "Oh well, it's good that you got through.  How's Ffierra doing?"You tell him that he is doing okay and that he sends his regards."That's good to hear," he reminisces.  "Keep an eye out in the outfitting area.  It won't be long before we have more work for you."C"Over here, old {G"boy" "girl"}," shrills a short, gaunt-looking older man with a huge moustache.  "Allow me to introduce myself.  I am Calvert-Smythe III, and you are <PN>, I presume?"You nod your head realizing that 'odd' isn't quite the word to describe this man; annoying would be closer."A bit of excitement out there I hear," Calvert-Smythe continues in his shrill voice, "but a bit of dashing gusto and what-ho, here you are."You begin to wonder how anyone could be quite this irritating."I cannot tell you, {G"old chap" "dear girl"}," he whines, "how glad we were when you came through.  Things were getting pretty grim around here, but, with a little derring-do, you made it."Anyway, here's your payment," he hands you a credit chip as you try not to wince at his offensive pitch.  "I might have some more work for you soon, keep looking in the ship outfitting area.  Jolly good show!"It occurs to you that the cleaners would probably get annoyed if you left a trail of his remains lying around so you decide not to attack him today.Commander Ffierra waves as you emerge from your craft.  "You don't know how glad I am you made it," he says, "I hear it got more than a little hairy out there.  I tell you what, I'm glad we've got guys out there like you who can deliver, come rain or shine.  We would be in a fair amount of trouble otherwise," he smiles suddenly.  "What did you think of Calvert-Smythe?"You roll your eyes and he laughs."He can be a bit hard to take all right," he smiles, becoming more serious.  "The Federation has a few more sensitive missions for you.  Go to Sol and ask for 'Commander Krane' in the bar and they should take you from there."He leans a little closer."Do yourself a favor," he explains in a warning tone, "if you have noticed in your travels that the Aurorans aren't building up along our border any more than usual, it would probably pay to keep it to yourself.  You know what they say about loose lips..."After asking the dockmaster for directions, you are directed to what appears to be a deserted office.  You enter somewhat self-consciously."Come in and shut the door," comes the{G" beautiful female " " "}voice of Commander Krane.  You quickly comply, feeling a little awkward."No troubles I take it?" she asks and you shake your head, immediately feeling foolish for doing so in the dark."Don't worry," she chuckles, "I can see you clearly."Nonetheless you did good work," she continues more seriously.  "You will find your bank account a little healthier for your little jaunt, and I am willing to continue your test.  If I want your services I will send someone to wait for you in the bar.  Until then your time is yours.  Good day, Captain <PN>."You head to the same, seemingly deserted office and once again enter self-consciously."There you are," sighs the{G" wonderful " " "}voice of Commander Krane.  "I was wondering when you would make it back."I guess that everything went relatively smoothly?" she asks and you shake your head, testing to find out if she can really see in the darkness."I can still see you," she confirms chuckling, "but it is good to see someone who has got good instincts."Her chair creaks as she shifts slightly."Well it seems as though you have made it through part two of the test," she continues more seriously.  "I have already transferred some money to your account for services rendered, and for now the testing will continue.  You are doing well so far, but don't get overconfident."I will send someone to wait for you in the bar if I need you again," she states dismissively.  "Until then your time is once again yours.  Good day <PN>."#You make your way to the seemingly empty office.  This time you manage to walk in with some self-assurance."Much better," comments Commander Krane on your entry.  "It is good to see your confidence rising."By the look on your face I can see that this last mission is causing you to ask some questions regarding what is actually going on," she continues smoothly.  "Good, that is exactly what I want.  Just remember that the whole point of these missions is to test your loyalty, and you should do okay."The next few episodes should tell whether you are with us," she continues pleasantly after a slight pause, "or against us."Her chair creaks as she shifts slightly as you mull over her last statement and its implications."Regardless, you are doing well so far," she praises sincerely, "and, as a result, you will find your account a little better off because of it.  Keep it up."If I need you again, the usual deal will apply," she states dismissively.  "Until then your time is once again yours.  Good day."1Once again you make your way to the seemingly empty office, this time walking in confidently."Welcome back," comes the{G" beautiful " " "}voice of Commander Krane.  "Another successful mission.  Things are looking good.  It looks as though I might have to step up the timetable for someone as worldly as yourself."But so far you have performed admirably," she praises you smoothly, "I only really have one remaining question as to the level of your loyalty.  Unfortunately I am going to have to wait until the right moment presents itself to test you for it.  But for now, you are free to do your own thing.  If I need you, I'll make contact with you in the bar as usual.  You will find a significant sum of money has been transferred into your account.  Enjoy yourself <PN>."As you pilot your way into one of <DST>'s docks, your comm system lights up and you receive a message from the leader of the counter-intel team you are supposed to be picking up telling you to meet them in the bar, they need your help on the ground.You wonder what help a single civilian could give, but as soon as you land you jump out of your ship leaving the engines hot in case you need to leave quickly and head off towards the bar.Surprisingly the room is well lit when you arrive, and inside you see a tall slim attractive woman in her mid-thirties with blue eyes and curly ash-blonde hair."Commander Krane?" you ask a little tentatively."Congratulations, Captain <PN>," comes the reply and you recognize that perfect voice instantly, "it seems that I can trust you after all.  After the last couple of missions when you came back with doubts all over your face I began to wonder if you were going to make it past this last hurdle, but obviously I was wrong."She sits down in an ancient chair which creaks every time she moves."It might be a while before I need you for anything worthy of your talents," she muses, "I don't want to start sending you off on stupid little assignments that can be handled by c-int teams, your efforts on the Federation front-line proved that you are worth more than that.  In the meantime you are being given the naval rank of commander, which is the rank given to all Bureau field operatives that might have to deal with the Federation military.  It means you get a meager salary, you get a discount when purchasing our goods and you don't have to buy licenses to get most things.  The only licenses you are still required to purchase are the 'fighter bay license' and the 'capital warships license'."Add all that to the fat contribution we just made to your bank account, and you should be enjoying a merry time of it until we require your services again!""Well done!" exclaims Mr. Chick when you exit your ship.  "I take it there were no troubles?"You smile and nod, quickly detailing the events of your trip to <DST>."Excellent," he drawls happily.  "Now we can get to work on mass-producing the darn things so that we can get them out to the fleet as soon as possible."I've organized for a payment of 25000 credits to go into your account," he concludes as he shakes your hand, "and you can keep the cloaking device.  May it prove useful to you in the future."With that he turns away and hurries off, presumably to give the order to start mass-production."Don't beat yourself up about getting scanned," Mr. Chick consoles you when you exit your ship.  "It just means that we will have to spend a couple of extra months changing the configuration of the device enough that Federation scanners will not be able to recognize it as a prohibited item.""Anyway," he concludes with quiet seriousness, "You can keep this cloaking device.  May it prove useful to you in the future, but be careful, the Feds now know that it is an illegal item."With that he turns away and hurries off, presumably to give the order to start changing the configuration of the cloaking device.  You cannot help but feel that you have let down the Rebellion as a whole.As soon as you land, you decide that you had better head to the bar to find out if anything is going on.You land on <RST> feeling completely miserable.  You cannot help but feel distraught at your current circumstances.  But, the images of what they did to you, and that heavy mass in your skull just behind your ear drive you onwards without mercy.  Somehow you stop yourself from crying and compose yourself as you go out to begin your betrayal of these good people.You have no choice.You are met by a slightly suspicious Rebel dockmaster who inquires as to your motives in seeking him out.  You explain that you feel obligated to do something for the Rebellion seeing as they are fighting the Bureau.  You tell him that what you have learned of the Bureau does not fit with your ideals for the Federation, and you are a {G "man" "woman"} of action and cannot just sit by and let them continue on their merry way.The dockmaster remains suspicious but decides against questioning you further."We always have a need for freighter captains," he explains, "and you can do that without actually gaining a lot of our secrets.  If you were planning on doing something more dangerous, you are going to have to prove yourself first."Go and see the dockmaster on Merrol in the Aldebaran system while he is off-duty in the bar and give him this," he hands you a data crystal.  "He should be able to find something for you."`As you head back to your ship you cannot help but grin.  It is always good to be working for an organization that is not only professional, but is also ruthless.  Ruthless not only with those it is striving against, but also with its own members.  You cannot wait to get into these rebel agent replacement missions.As you head back to your beloved <PSN>, you wonder how you can live with yourself doing what you are doing to these brave rebels.  Nobody deserves to go through what was done to you, and you have no doubt that they will be subjected to it as well.After you spend over an hour sitting at the controls sweating, shaking and weeping uncontrollably you recover and head out into space in the deepest despair of your life.  You see only two paths ahead of you; death or damnation.  Which will it be for you...UYour passenger exits straight into the arms of the waiting Bureau 'investigators'.  He looks confused for a second before going red and turning on you, enraged.  He lunges only to be forcefully restrained by the pick up team."You're going to pay for this!" the rebel agent yells with impotent fury."Well I doubt it will be by your hand," you state sardonically.  "Enjoy your all expenses paid for holiday my friend, care of the Bureau."One of the men restraining the rebel club him over the head with a short baton and he slumps unconscious."Good thinking," nods the leader and the man is dragged away.  She turns to you, "Commander Krane isn't around at the moment, but I'll make sure she hears about this.  We will have a replacement for you to take back to the rebels in a few hours.  Meet us in the bar."RFiona looks a little confused when she sees the Bureau strongarms when she steps out of your hatch.  Comprehension comes slowly as she turns to you in despair.  You have no wish to hear any of her whining so you give a push and she stumbles into the arms of the waiting Bureau team.."Thanks," says one of them casually as another smashes her over the head a few times with the short batons they all seem to carry."Commander Krane left a message that she will make contact with you soon and that you are being temporarily relieved from active duty," says the attractive team leader as her team drags away the unconscious rebel.  "She says to keep an eye out in bars and mission BBS's around the place in case she needs to get in contact with you.  We will take care of the rest of this operation to replace her with one of our own."You {G"take a few moments to savor the sight of" "spend a few moments thinking on the necessity of your actions as"} the team leader {G"walking" "walks"} away from you and you wonder why Krane has taken you off the active duty list.E"I have to pass on your intel to the proper people," she tells seriously, "but I don't want you wandering too far.  Once I've gotten confirmation on a few things, I will need your services again.  Keep an eye out in the bar."By the way," she continues with a smile, "I have just authorized you access to certain types of Federation technology.  It doesn't come cheap I'm afraid, but you will now be able to buy it."I've been pushing for you to be allowed access to the better stuff," she explains apologetically, "but the military types don't like to give away what they view as their personal technology easily."However if your work continues as it has," she informs you quietly, "I can guarantee that it won't be long until you will be granted access to everything in the Federation arsenal!"As soon as you land you head off to find Krane's office, leaving the maintenance crew to give your craft the once over."Things went well?" asks Krane politely when you enter.  You nod with a shrug.  "Well, your little diversion worked.  The Moash warriors were drawn to the site of your raid which allowed the amassed Federation fleet to launch an attack on the skeletal defenses which broke through their line almost immediately."You nod at her confirmation of your suspicions."By all accounts," she explains with a smile, "most of the Moash fleet has either been defeated or captured, and we are in possession of their homeworld.  More than that, we managed to grab the house elders before they managed to escape."Now that you're back," she informs you dismissively, "I'll be needing you for a diplomatic mission of sorts.  Come to the bar in two hours, I'll have everything ready for you by then."In conclusion, you inform them that if the Moash House decides to accept the Bureau proposal, they will greatly enhance their power within the Auroran Empire, and indeed the galaxy as a whole, and they only have to acknowledge that they must abide by Bureau policy.  And in general, you explain, Bureau policy is deliberately designed to keep the status quo by keeping the masses happy and by keeping its own involvement completely secret.The elders confer amongst themselves for some time before your patience runs out.  You stand telling them that they have two hours to reach a decision, and that you will await their response in the bar.You walk out with several Bureau negotiators in tow all trying to talk to you at once.  You tell them in no uncertain terms to leave you alone and head to the bar to quench your thirst after your long flight here.You are surprised to see the blonde hair and athletic figure of Krane waiting for you when you step out of your ship."So what did they say?" she asks quietly as she takes your arm and draws you out of earshot of the dock workers securing your craft.  You give her a quick summary of the events of your trip and she looks pleased."Good work!" her cheeks dimple attractively as she smiles at you.  "Our plans are proceeding nicely.  I have a few things I have to take care of, so I will probably be a little out of contact for a while, but it shouldn't be too long before I need your services again.  Keep an eye out in bars anywhere in the Federation.  When I need you again, I'll find you."When you exit your ship you are met by the soldier who is normally your contact in the bar who draws you aside out of the main stream of foot-traffic in the spaceport."Commander Krane is currently detained doing other things at the moment," he explains seriously, "but she wanted me to pass on her thanks for your efforts so far.  She also wanted me to tell you that she will need your talents again in the near future when the plans you just delivered to the Moash start coming to fruition.  In the meantime, take care of yourself and don't worry too much about keeping in contact.  If we need your help again, we'll find you."The soldier claps his hand on your shoulder, nods and walks away, quickly disappearing into the crowd.  You notice after the fact that he seems to have the ability to blend into the crowd and be completely inconspicuous, even though he wears the very distinctive uniform of a Federation naval officer.`Upon landing on <RST> you are again met by the soldier who is normally your contact in the bar.  He quickly draws you aside."A new situation has arisen," he explains urgently, "and Commander Krane wants you to head over to the Kane Band and she will meet you there.  She stressed to me that this is of the utmost importance, and that you should hurry."The soldier jovially claps his hand on your shoulder and shakes his finger at you with a smile before ruffling your hair and moving away saying that he will see you later tonight.  Anyone watching would have thought the exchange was between two old friends meeting for the first time in a long while.  You smile at his disappearing back and shake your head in keeping with the charade, and you head back into your ship to begin prepping your ship for another spaceflight.You are greeted by the muscular-looking Jay when you land."Glad to see you're back!" he exclaims, clapping you on the shoulder nearly knocking you over.  "What happened to you?"As the two of you walk along together you explain that the Federation had begun to recognize your ship and you decided that rather than risk being taken you would head elsewhere for a while.  You spin a few false yarns about adventures you had in Auroran Space before going on to tell him that things were starting to get too hot down there when Federation ships started showing up, so you decided to come back here."Well you've come back at an opportune time," he informs you a little bit mysteriously.  "I believe that the Rebellion is in need of a ship that is not on the current Federation list of suspicious ships.  Meet me in the bar when my shift finishes, we'll talk more then."o"Everything seems to be in order," notes 'Dorraj' after making a quick inspection of the contents of the message pod, "but I will require a little time to examine this in greater detail.  Meet me in the bar in three hours and I shall have a reply for you."As he walks away you cannot help grinning when you realize that the Bureau is not only going to decisively vanquish the Rebels as a result of this mission, but it will also gain a serious hold over the President of the Federation.With a final chuckle you head off to the bar to await Mr. Milamber's reply to the Rebel message.Upon landing you are met by a Rebel officer who introduces himself as Captain Daniels and takes the encrypted message pod off you."General Smart wanted me to pass on his thanks," he informs you in that slightly official tone used by military personnel the universe over, "and also to inform you that a significant amount of money has been transferred into your account."There will undoubtedly be a follow-up to this mission," he explains forthrightly, "and we will be wanting your services for it, as we like to keep showing delicate contacts familiar faces.  When we have gotten things organized we will look for you in the bar."You step off your ship and are greeted by 'Dorraj', and you notice with amusement that this time his moustache and hair actually match.  You pull him aside and pass on the Rebel message in a terse voice."Your office, Sol, four weeks."He nods, thanks you and moves off.After he disappears into the crowd you smile nastily and head back on board your ship and begin prepping it for another spaceflight.  You cannot wait to get this intelligence to the Bureau offices on New England.  With this information the Bureau could clean up the Rebellion in one swoop, and take care of one would-be sneaky president.  Things are definitely looking up.O"I've heard a lot about you," Frandall says as he rises to shake your hand.  "I hear you have been invaluable in helping along the Auroran operation."Don't look so surprised," he continues as you look on stunned.  "Early on we knew that we would not be able to keep our activities secret from certain people.  So I decided that I would start a rebel movement to root out all the malcontents.  The end result was the rebellion, and given their limited resources, they were never going to get very far.  So we merely waited for our time to strike."On another note," he says with a sly grin, "the rebel leaders, other than General Smart, have all been broken and are confessing to whatever we want them to.  Unfortunately for us, military training includes torture resistance, so General Smart died before we could get anything out of him.""By the way," Commander Krane informs you, "we authorized access to all but the absolute highest level of Federation technology.  What you have access to now is all expensive, but if you have the money, it is all worth it."$You are met by the {G"beautiful" "blonde haired"} Commander Krane who takes you to see Frandall for your debrief.  The two of them grill you for nearly an hour on everything you saw while on Moash, skillfully pulling information out of you, most of which you would not normally remember.  You realize that these two are far more competent than you have ever believed.  You are glad to be serving on their side."You have done well," sighs Frandall eventually.  "I cannot fault your work or your intuitive conclusions regarding the emotional state of the Moash.  It's good to see that everything I've heard about you is true."Commander Krane stands up and moves around the desk to shake your hand, and you realize that the interview is at an end."Thanks again, Captain <PN>," she congratulates with a smile, "this whole operation would have been nearly impossible without you.  Keep an eye out in the bars around the place, we will have another sensitive mission coming up soon, and you are the ideal candidate for it."Once again you are met by Krane and she escorts you to your debriefing where both she and Frandall grill you for some time.  After nearly two hours they sit back, apparently satisfied."Well, it looks like we have managed to deal with the Rebels, the Aurorans, and now the President," chuckles Frandall.  "Within a few days we will basically control most of Known Space.""We still have to think about the Polaris," warns Krane seriously, "and I doubt that they will be so easy.""I'm not so sure," muses Frandall thoughtfully.  "I don't think that they will be able to stay out of this situation for long.  I believe that it won't be too long before we hear from them."In the mean time," he continues after turning back to you, "we have managed to get you clearance to purchase the Carrier.  I recommend you buy it, because if the Polaris do contact us we'll be sending you to them, and you'll want all the firepower you can get.  Keep an eye out in the bar, if we need you that's where we'll look for you."The woman at the head of the table stands up and addresses you clearly."I am Bis Andreya," she begins seriously, "I am the leader of the Polaris.  We must warn you that we are sickened by the actions of yourself and your 'Bureau', and, if it were at all possible, we would want to have nothing to do with you.  Unfortunately, now that you have maneuvered your way into the ownership of the Aurorans, we have no choice but to deal with you.  For with the resources now at your disposal, you pose too serious a security risk to ignore."This council is yet to come to a decision on what our offer to your government will be," she slightly emphasizes the word 'government', obviously trying to get a rise out of you, "but by the end of this session, a decision will be reached.  If you would be so kind as to await the outcome of our deliberations in the bar, within a few hours you can be on your way back to your masters with our opening position."As usual you are met by Commander Krane who takes you to a debrief with Frandall.  The two of them work you over for nearly six hours until they both seem satisfied that every little drop of intelligence has been gleaned from your memory.  At the end of the session you all sit back feeling exhausted."This is certainly an interesting development," muses Frandall thoughtfully.  "I wasn't expecting the Polaris to be so direct as to make an offer of alliance so soon.  Nor did I expect them to make such a tempting offer.  I wonder what their angle is?""Perhaps we should make use of the 'one diplomat' condition of the proposal," Krane comments tiredly.  "We could send someone in to have a look around."Frandall nods, looking at you shrewdly."Meet us in the bar in two hours, Captain <PN>," he says quietly.  "I will see about getting you clearance to be our lone diplomat so that I can send you over there to have a look around."CAs soon as you land you hear your hatch opening without you giving your computer the code to do so, and suddenly two gray men enter your cockpit.  Before you are aware of it you are face-down on the floor.  You are quickly and thoroughly searched by the men as another gray-cloaked woman searches your ship.  You are picked up like you weigh nothing and are carried outside and dumped at the feet of an attractive woman who also wears the same gray clothes, the only difference being her brown collar."I am Iuso," she introduces herself calmly.  "You have absolutely no business landing on this station.  Why are you here?"You stammer that you are a Federation diplomat, wandering through Polaris Space in an attempt to gauge the reaction of the Polaris people to the proposal sent to your government."I see," she comments nonplussed.  "I will check this with the council.  If you could give me a few moments, I will clear this all up."She nods to your captors and you know that although that was phrased as a request, it was nothing of the sort.Following the usual protocols, Krane takes you to your debrief where both she and Frandall question you at length regarding your trip.  After they squeeze from you every possible detail, they sit back looking tired."It looks like we may have a small problem," Frandall comments quietly.  "There is no doubt that the Federation will accept this proposal as it stands, and then we will be fighting something of a rearguard action to retain our influence from thereon in.  We may have to figure out ways of reindoctrinating people once they come back from the Polaris.""You did well on your last mission," says Krane, shaking her head at Frandall.  "Keep an eye out because we will be in contact soon as we will undoubtedly need you for another mission soon into Polaris space.  We have transferred a sizeable sum of money into your account, so go out there and enjoy yourself while you can."Suddenly the screen becomes unbearably bright, and you hear the sound of a loud explosion.  When the screen clears you can clearly see the charred remains of the official party lying dead.  You continue watching, stunned, and you see a couple of Bis Andreya's bodyguards, somehow reaching their feet despite their horrific burns, make their way offscreen."Pretty tough buggers to survive a thermite blast," comments Frandall thoughtfully.  "Oh well, we need a few of them to make it back to Polaris space anyway."You turn around, looking confused."This was the plan all along," explains Frandall.  "We couldn't allow this alliance to come to fruition, it would mean the gradual erosion of our control, and the very act of bringing in an outside factor was an act of rebellion by the Federation Council that we couldn't let go unpunished."We're heading back to New England," he continues thoughtfully.  "Meet us there in a few weeks and we will have something for you."$As soon as you dock on this station you are greeted by a party of five heavily tattooed warriors.  They tell you that Elder Kerachk is currently out on exercises with some of his warriors, but that a message informing him of your arrival has been sent and that he will be not more than a few hours away.You bow low and thank them for their courtesy and tell them that you will await for his return in the bar.  They bow low in return agreeing to pass on your message as soon as he arrives back on the station.After watching the Aurorans depart the system back towards their awaiting fleet you decide that it is time to head back to New England to find out if Krane or Frandall need any help with anything.  You wonder how the Polaris/Federation war is coming; for all you know, it might be over and the Federation lost.With that thought you launch yourself back towards Earth.As soon as you land your battered ship is surrounded by a swarm of technicians.  In the tumult you spot Krane and she takes you to a debrief where she and Frandall get you to go over the events of your Auroran mission, and the battle with the Polaris Raven.  After questioning you for several hours they relax, apparently satisfied."It seems that we have managed to pull it all together," remarks Frandall in his underhanded way.  "You won't yet know this, but the Polaris have sent a diplomatic envoy directly to me surrendering unconditionally to the Bureau.  And while they will be doing their best to subvert us to their way of thinking through education, we have a firm grip on the situation, and we are now in a position to deal with any threat that they will come to pose.""And much of this is thanks to you, <PN>," congratulates Krane {G"prettily" "warmly"}.  "Without you, this could well have turned into a shambles.  Meet me in the bar in two hours, as it appears we have one last loose end to tie up."$"Are you threatening me?" asks the President, suddenly smug.  "Did you know that I am allowed to order any action to protect myself against any and all threats during a state of emergency?  I'm sure you agree that I cannot allow myself to be threatened by people who should be working for me," he turns to his bodyguards.  "Shoot her, will you."The bodyguard draws his weapon and smashes it against the President's temple, hard."Thank you for pointing that out, Mr. President," Krane continues unruffled.  "As you can see, we still have the upper-hand.  You WILL do what we want, or you will be killed.  Now, about your speech this evening..."********It takes you another twenty years, but you eventually rid yourself of both Krane and Frandall to become the unassailable ruler of all humanity.  Upon taking up the mantle of leadership you gently rub your hands together before executing a plan to begin molding humanity into your own image.  After all, what is absolute power good for, other than to challenge God?~Your passenger exits straight into the arms of the waiting Bureau 'investigators'.  He looks confused for a second before going red and turning on you, enraged.  He lunges only to be forcefully restrained by the pick up team."You're going to pay for this!" the rebel agent yells with impotent fury.Once again you are overwhelmed by a sense of self-loathing and when the former rebel agent spits in your face it takes you a few long seconds to find the strength to wipe it away.One of the men restraining the rebel club him over the head with a short baton and he slumps unconscious."Good thinking," nods the leader and the man is dragged away.  She turns to you, "Commander Krane isn't around at the moment, but I'll make sure she hears about this.  We will have a replacement for you to take back to the rebels in a few hours.  Meet us in the bar."PWhen you get into his office you watch miserably as he goes over and starts rummaging through his desk drawers."Here it is," he says at last pulling out a credit chip.  "This should keep you eating for a few more days."I'll see to it that the General Smarts of this universe hear about this," he promises more seriously as he hands you the chip, "it never hurts to get in a little good PR."You turn to leave after he claps you on the shoulder and with the self-loathing only another broken man would understand, you head back out into the spaceport.6Fiona looks a little confused when she sees the Bureau strongarms when she steps out of your hatch.  Comprehension comes slowly as she turns to you in despair.  You cannot bring yourself to look into her eyes as she is quickly overpowered."Thanks," says one of them casually as another smashes her over the head a few times with the short batons they all seem to carry."Commander Krane left a message that she will make contact with you soon and that you are being temporarily relieved from active duty," says the attractive team leader as her team drags away the unconscious rebel.  "We will take care of the rest of the operation to replace her with one of our own."It takes you a few moments to summon the strength to work yourself free of the misery to nod in acknowledgment.Jay sees your distress and puts his arm over your shoulders and whispers in your ear, "Don't worry, all this is mainly because the head-sheds decided to send out the details of your exploits in order to boost morale amongst the troops.  Don't worry, no names were mentioned, although I don't doubt that a few people will start putting two and two together, but for now your secret is fairly safe."General Smart wants you to get back to doing what you were doing before all this came up," he continues supportively, "which was working with me!"So I'm just going to give you access to the same missions from the mission BBS as you had before," he tells you cheerfully.  "When you're ready, and if you're around you can pick them up if you want to.  In the mean time I suggest you get a few drinks into you.  After what you went through I would be getting plastered and staying that way!"Damn, it's good to have you back <PN>."zYou follow Jay into his spartanly furnished office and he sits you down on a comfortable chair."I take it," he states, "that you will be wanting to move your way up the ranks to the more exciting missions."When you nod he grins and claps you on the shoulder again."Good to hear," he says with an approving smile.  "Of course, we live in times when trust is at a minimum, and if you want to become involved in the more exciting missions, then you have to prove yourself worthy by doing plenty of the tedious, lower risk runs."To get you started," he goes on, "I'm going to make these food drops a regular occurrence, and each one you do will go a little way to proving yourself to the Rebel High Muck-Mucks."You nod in understanding."In the meantime, here's 15000 credits to play with," he hands over a credit chip, "have a few drinks on me."(You find Jay in his office hard at work on his computer."Come in, come in," he says brusquely in response to your knocking.  "Back already?  Oh well it's good to see you, we were looking a little short again, but your shipment should see us right."He fumbles around inside the draws of his desk finally pulling out a slightly dirty credit chip."I believe that this is what you are looking for?" he says with a grin.  "Keep checking the Mission BBS, it won't be long until we'll be needing you services again."Once again you follow Jay into his spartanly furnished office and he sits you down in the same comfortable chair."It looks to me," he states with a mischievous grin, "as though the people in charge of this are starting to look your way."He claps you on the shoulder again."Well, you're on the way," he says with an approving smile.  "Of course, it will take some time, and things won't happen overnight, but I think that you have begun your long journey to the top.  Keep putting in the hard yards and you should get there."To help you out," he goes on, "I'm going to clear you to receive these equipment drops from the Mission BBS so that you can clock up a few more brownie points."You nod, understanding that your willingness to do this sort of grunt work will go a long way towards impressing the people in charge of your loyalty."In the meantime, here's a whopping 25000 credits to play with," he hands over a credit chip, "have a few drinks on me."You find Jay in his office hard at work on his computer like he normally is."Back again so soon?" he responds in a surprised voice in response to your knocking.  "Good work!  It's good to see someone who is prepared to do a little extra for the cause, and given the way things are going we are certainly going to need every little bit of what you just brought in."He fumbles around inside the drawers of his desk finally pulling out a slightly dirty credit chip."I believe that this is what you are looking for?" he says with a grin.  "Keep checking the Mission BBS, it won't be long until we'll be needing you services again."You walk in to see a vaguely familiar figure with short hair and a military bearing."Allow me to introduce myself," the man says easily, reaching forward to shake your hand.  "My name is Cade Smart, retired General."You realize that you are talking to one of the founding members of the Rebellion.  You remember vaguely that General Cade 'Sundown' Smart, as he was called, took command of the Federation's forces when the Aurorans had wiped out whole fleets of the Federation Navy under the incompetent command of his predecessor.  His brilliance kept the Federation alive at a time when its destruction looked a virtual certainty."I want you to know that we have been following your career carefully," General Smart continues, "and I wanted to pass on my appreciation for what you are doing.  We are truly grateful for your efforts."Jay tells me that he is going to make similar missions available to you through the mission BBS, and I can think of no-one better for the job.  Thank you, Captain <PN>."When you get into his office he goes over and starts rummaging through his desk drawers."Here it is," he says at last pulling out a credit chip.  "This should keep you eating for a few more days."I'll see to it that the General Smarts of this universe hear about this," he promises more seriously as he hands you the chip, "it never hurts to get in a little good PR."Jay sees your distress and puts his arm over your shoulders and whispers in your ear, "Don't worry, all this is mainly because the head-sheds decided to send out the details of your exploits in order to boost morale amongst the troops.  Don't worry, no names were mentioned, although I don't doubt that a few people will start putting two and two together, but for now your secret is fairly safe."General Smart wants you to get back to doing what you were doing before all this came up," he continues supportively, "which was working with me!"So I hope you like extractions, because I've programmed the mission BBS to allow you access to them," he tells you cheerfully.  "Whenever they come up I'll post them, and if you're around you can pick them up if you want to.  In the mean time I suggest you get a few drinks into you.  After what you went through I would be getting plastered and staying that way!"Damn, it's good to have you back <PN>."You look over to see the muscular figure of Jay walking towards you."All go well?" he asks cheerfully.  You nod and he continues expansively, "Let's go to my office, I have a credit chip with your name on it."The two of you head off the concourse to the building where his office is located whereupon he goes through the familiar ritual of rummaging through his desk drawers."Here it is," he says at last pulling the chip.  "This should keep you eating for a few more days."I'll see to it that the head-sheds hear about this," he promises with a grin, "it's always good to see a decent {G"man" "woman"} get ahead in this sad universe of ours."xYou look over to see the muscular figure of Jay walking towards you."Everything go okay?" he asks cheerfully.  You nod and he continues expansively, "Then let's get you paid.  You know the way."The two of you head off the concourse to the building where his office is located whereupon he goes through the familiar ritual of rummaging through his desk draws."Here it is," he says at last pulling out a credit chip.  "This should keep you eating for a few more days."Keep checking in," he advises with a cheeky grin, "it's starting to look like I might have a bit more work for you soon."!You are greeted by General Smart and a rather non-descript man just short of 6 feet, slim build and a slightly hooked nose."Welcome to Intel," states General Smart as he shakes your hand.  He indicates the man standing next to him.  "Allow me to introduce Geoff Daniels, he will be your intel supervisor."The two of you shake hands, eyeing each other curiously."I've heard good things about you," Geoff says positively, "it's nice to finally meet you.  Why don't you have a look around the station and meet me in the bar in an hour or so.  I need the time to come up with your code name and to hammer out the details of your first mission."We have also cleared you to purchase many of our ships, such as they are, but of course you can keep your current ship if you wish."General Smart leans over, and announces in a conspiratorial whisper loud enough for Daniels to hear, "Watch out for these spooks, they think they run the universe."Geoff Daniels just smiles gently, "But we do, General, didn't you know?"You are surprised to be greeted by five of the six founding members of the Rebellion.  One by one Mu'Randa is introduced to General Smart, Cardinal Vardy de Valera, former head of theological studies of the Church of Krim-Hwa, Professor Barry Williams, former Vice-Chancellor of Kane University, Mr. Donald Chick, former CEO of Sigma Shipyards and Dr. Oriallo Pentecost, former Port Kane representative to the Federation Council.  The only one missing is the mysterious Frandall.  But then, according to rumor, he has not been seen in public for several years now.Mu'Randa is led away by General Smart and you are left standing, not knowing what to do until you see Geoff Daniels coming over."Quite a show of rank wouldn't you say," he says with an indolent grin.  You nod looking a little confused.  "We had an inkling that this might happen," he explains, "so we prepared ahead of time.  Regardless, she'll need transport back soon, and that'll be you.  Stay near the bar.  I might need you in a hurry.""Thank you Ory-Hara," says the delighted Mu'Randa, "your help has been much appreciated in this matter.  Very few non-Nil'kemorya (that is the Polaris name for our warrior caste) pilots would have even attempted the journey you did.  And to get past all those Federation vessels undetected was masterful.  You have earned not only my respect, but when my people hear of your deeds, you will have earned theirs also."Were you aware that the word 'Ory'hara' means something in Polaris?" she asks quietly.  "It is a little difficult to translate, but it comes out as something like 'eternal vigilance' or even 'recurring vigilance', although it also has connotations of stealth and to a lesser extent cunning.  An interesting piece of trivia don't you think?"Now if you could go to the bar and await me," she informs you quietly, "I will return as quickly as I can with the council's answer."After the three Rebel leaders depart you see your supervisor Geoff walk over to you."You're starting to make a big impression," he says with a cheerful smile.  "Everybody around here is talking about you, the latest big name in the Rebel ranks, and rightly so.""Why don't you take a few days R&R?" he suggests clapping you on the shoulder.  "If anyone has earned it you have, but keep checking back here because it won't be too long before I need you again."Oh, and by the way," he suddenly remembers, "I don't know if you've noticed, but we have been transferring money into your account as payment.  I made sure you got a hefty sum this time around.  You deserve it."You enter a large room with about forty terminals all manned by headset-wearing personnel.  Geoff immediately goes up to the nearest terminal and looks over the shoulder of its operator.  His eyes widen slightly."Where did you get these readings?" he asks calmly.You tell him that they were picked up on <DST> in the <DSY> system."Really..." he muses.  "There's an awful lot of traffic going in and out of a planet that is best known as a retirement spot.  Interesting..."He turns to you with an absent-minded nod and grimaces slightly."By the way," Geoff continues, "we have cleared you for purchase of Rebel capital ships as well.  If would like to have one, you can now buy them wherever we have a shipyard."Come by the bar in the next few days," he informs you seriously.  "By then they'll have done at least a preliminary analysis of the data, and I reckon that I'll have something for you.  In the meantime enjoy the credits we've put into your account."(Upon landing you are greeted by Geoff."What did you find?" he asks smiling.You quickly relay the events of your trip and he just as quickly loses his smile."This is bad," he comments seriously.  "But maybe we can turn it to our advantage.  How long do you reckon it will take the Roughnecks until they are ready to begin operating independently inside Auroran space?"You tell him that they are ready to begin now, but if they are going to stick to the three month stockpile, then they probably still require possibly another two months.  Geoff mulls that over for a moment."Good work," he say finally.  "Come by the bar soon, and I will have something for you.  I think that it's too late to head it off, but we might yet manage to squeeze something out of it.""In the meantime I had several chats with Mr. Flannigan," he smiles reminiscing.  "He is a very astute man.  Very few people in the universe are anywhere near as well informed about the events that go on throughout the galaxy.  He does have a weakness about Raczak though.  It goes back to an incident several years ago between the two of them where Raczak refused to admit that he had been saved by Flannigan and his men.  Apparently that annoyed the hell out of the Wild Geese leader, and they have basically been at each others throats ever since."I don't know how Raczak does it," he continues shaking his head in disbelief.  "If I had irritated a man as capable as Eamon Flannigan I would be going out of my way to make it up to him somehow."Good work out there," Geoff praises warmly as he snaps out of his reverie.  "Keep stopping by the bar.  It shouldn't be too long before I have something else for you."H"So what did you find?" asks Geoff after you step out of your ship.You relay the events of your trip and he raises his eyebrows when you mention the presence of the two vessels with Federation identifications in the Aurora system."Are you sure?" he asks, surprised.  You nod.  "Can you tell me their designations?"You reply that the techies can probably do better than that once they analyze the data from the holo-scanner you took with you."True," he agrees with a sheepish grin.  "This incident has sparked my interest.  I think that it will be very interesting to find out what is going on down there.  It is not at all like Aurorans to impersonate the Federation."Anyway," he continues brusquely, "stay close to the bar.  I get the feeling that I will need your expertise again very soon.""This is the analysis of recent data gained from the holo-scanner on New England," he explains in a no-nonsense professional manner.  "They show that the Bureau has been organizing Federation forces into two enormous fleets.  They have been passing on 'intelligence' regarding Auroran major thrusts into Federation space."From reports coming from the front," he continues briskly, "these Auroran strikes have actually been made up of countless ships from four of the five major houses.  But not one Moash ship has been sent against them!"I'm willing to bet that the Bureau is going to send Raczak's men into a waiting trap where he will be annihilated within Federation space," he states forcefully.  "They will then inflame public opinion and send the troops off to war against the four houses that will be severely depleted, and the first family won't lift a finger to help them!"Wait for me in the bar," Geoff says, suddenly impassive, "I'm going to have another mission for you within the hour."B"As you{b818 " " " probably"} already know," he explains thoughtfully, "I am a warrior of the Heraan House.  If I were to travel with you, you would not have to deal with young warriors challenging you just to be allowed to step foot on their planet.  They would also be more likely to listen to what you had to say if I were there to back you."You nod saying that you are more than happy to have him along to help out in any way, especially if it would speed things up.  You ask if he has any advice about dealing with the Rimertans."They call themselves 'Dechtakars'," he answers almost reverently, "which translates roughly as 'we who sacrifice ourselves for the highest cause'.  They are loyal to the first family, but their honor is beyond question.  And yes, I can help with them.  As a fellow Auroran warrior of many battles who has fought alongside them on many occasions, my word carries some weight."I need a couple of hours to organize {b818 "the Geese" "my men"}," he decides finally.  "Meet me in the bar and I will journey with you."#You explain that if they do not, then the Heraan House will in all likelihood be destroyed.  If they do decide go along with the plan, they will have extra ships to bolster their defense in the coming battles.The eldest warrior turns to Eamon asking, "Don't you have blood oath against Raczak?" to which Eamon nods.  "Then how can you fight beside him?""By imagining his reaction when he realizes that I have been the one who rescued him a second time," he replies, receiving approving chuckles from around the table.The eldest warrior nods slowly and turns back to you."We will do this thing you ask," he decides with finality.  "For I cannot stand to let any house bring about the ruin of everything we have fought and died for.  Ory-Hara, I believe that many songs will be sung about the coming days, and I will make sure that you are mentioned."He then dismisses you with a wave of his hand.Eamon quickly moves to your side."I want to see a few people," he says quietly.  "Meet me in the bar in an hour."#You reply saying the Rebels are worried that Auroran counter-attacks, however justified they may be, will further muddy an already messy situation.  You also explain that because an Auroran House is involved, a civil war might result, and you do not want to give the Bureau any chance to expand their influence further.  Your leaders want to cause as much damage to the Bureau as possible."So all you want from us is that we be present in or around Heraan space in the next few weeks?" asks the ancient warrior heading the table and you nod in confirmation.  He closes his eyes in thought for a moment before reaching a decision."We will do what you ask," he announces quietly.  "You are not dragging us into a squabble between Houses as I initially feared.  We thank you for your information.  With it we may stop our enemies from destroying the Empire.  We are in your debt."He dismisses you with a wave of his hand.Eamon gives you the thumbs up as you leave and informs you that he will meet you bar in an hour.You are greeted by your supervisor 'Geoff' as you walk down the ramp."I'm guessing that Eamon let slip who I am," he says without preamble.You reply that Mr. Flannigan is of the opinion that you are Frandall."Well he's right," chuckles Frandall, "and it's good to see that you're still keeping your cards close to your chest, even with me!""Especially with you," you reply with a sardonic smile.  Frandall laughs."So you got everything in place?" he asks and you nod in confirmation.  "Excellent.  Meet me in the bar in two hours.  We have another mission that I believe can only be completed by you."As she is led away you feel a tap on your shoulder and you turn to see a man who is vaguely familiar indicating that you should follow him.  He takes you into one of the many Intel offices and turns to you."If you're wondering why you don't recognize me," he says with the familiar voice of Frandall, "it's because I have had surgery to alter my appearance.  I don't want to be recognized in public by that young lady and revealed."You did very well on this last mission," he continues cheerfully, "but unfortunately we will need a couple of other weapons against her.  You see, we want to put her in a Vell-os trial, but the Vell-os are still an enslaved race."He holds up a hand to stall your questions."Yes I know the propaganda says that they now serve the Federation willingly," he explains cynically, "I created it, but it isn't true."I have an idea though," he continues thoughtfully.  "Keep an eye out here, once I've hammered out all the details I'll be waiting for you."You are greeted by a smiling Frandall when you land.  Mu'Randa is surprised to find out that the man she knew as your supervisor is the mysterious Frandall."I didn't even realize that you had assumed a false identity," she exclaims in confusion.  "How did you do that?""I have no real identity," answers Frandall with a wry smile.  "I make any identity I take on my real one.  It also allows me to operate around the Vell-os without being discovered, which is useful.  For even if they didn't point me out because they realized that I was a rebel, their reaction to my presence if they were aware that I was using a false identity could be enough to give me away."Now, ladies and gentlemen," he bows courteously, "If you would please come this way to meet the other leaders of the Rebellion, we can brief you on the exact details of the situation and we can begin the operation."Ory-Hara, if you could meet me in the bar in two hours," he states without looking at you, "I will explain the next phase to you."Krane looks momentarily confused."What?" she blurts out, her voice nearly lost amongst the clamoring."She is guilty of every crime she is accused of," says the Vell-os judge, somehow audible over the noise of the crowd."You shouldn't be able to say that," Krane says in a shaky voice."Why?" returns the judge lifting his 'traditional' long hair to reveal a technological device attached to the base of his skull.  "Because you have kept us your slaves for over six centuries?  Well learn that there are people who are civilized enough to help us, and in my freedom I condemn you to the worst punishment the Federation constitution allows for.  Lifetime incarceration in solitary confinement.  I also suggest that the entire Bureau of Internal Investigators be disbanded for the security of the Federation.  This court is adjourned."In the following hubbub General Smart finds you and yells across the crowd that he wants to see you in the bar as soon as both of you can get there.[Within a day the President bows to public pressure and steps down, but not before calling for Federation-wide general elections.  To your surprise you realize that the Rebellion has won their war.  They have destroyed the Bureau and as a result the Federation will return to what it once was before the Bureau twisted it into something unwholesome.You figure that you are out of a job as you doubt they will need too many people with your abilities in the new regime.  You shrug your shoulders, thinking that you can handle becoming another freighter captain for a while.  You decide that you will not mind leaving the excitement to other, younger pilots.Your thoughts are interrupted when your comm beeps, indicating an incoming pre-recorded message.  It turns out to be Mu'Randa who asks to meet with you in the bar.Rumors abounded, but the only information found was that during the troubles that preceded the unification of humanity there had been a {G"man" "woman"} who had gone by the name 'Ory-Hara', who had then immediately dropped out of sight.  Not even the Polaris, who were rumored to have last seen {G"him" "her"}, knew where {G"he" "she"} might have gone.Over the next 10,000 years humanity developed, and suffered the occasional nearly cataclysmic setback.  Every time the name 'Ory-hara' was mentioned by those who had led humanity back from the brink, and still none seemed to understand.Eventually humanity began to slowly evolve and began to move beyond these limited dimensions, and finally they began to see.The last human, before evolving into the beyond, looked around at the physical universe laid out in all its glory and said one last word in a satisfied voice."Ory'hara."!After the three Rebel leaders depart you see your supervisor Geoff walk over to you."You're starting to make a big impression," he says with a cheerful smile.  "Everybody around here is talking about you, the latest big name in the Rebel ranks, and rightly so.""Why don't you take a few days R&R?" he suggests clapping you on the shoulder.  "If anyone has earned it you have but keep checking back here because it won't be too long before I need you again."Oh, and by the way," he suddenly remembers, "I don't know if you've noticed, but we have been transferring money into your account as payment.  I made sure you got a hefty sum this time around.  You deserve it."As you watch him walk away you cannot help feeling uneasy receiving the praise of these men given that you succeeded in this mission more by good luck than through any skill of yours.  Despite this you quickly shake it off and shrug your shoulders.  At the end of the day you did succeed and everyone deserves a lucky break every now and again.cAs soon as you land you are greeted by a strangely familiar Rebel technician who takes the datapad off you and immediately hooks it into a nearby terminal.  After a few seconds he turns around and returns the datapad to you."Here are the codes," he grins.  "Feel free to use the hypergates to jump all over the galaxy."With that he walks off and disappears into the spaceport.  You cannot help but wonder at his appearance, but you put it down to having met him somewhere in your wide travels throughout the galaxy.After a few moments of contemplation you shrug and turn your thoughts to the information in your hand.  With a grin, you realize that you now have easy access to parts of the galaxy that before were always extremely difficult to get to.  Whistling, you head off to install the codes into your ship's computer.{Techerakh waves you to a seat, and tells you that he is glad that you went to such extremes to save the spy's life.  Apparently the information in the man's initial report was enough for the War Council to place a number of other operatives on the task of keeping tabs on crucial Moash shipping, and more cryptically, on some specific Federation ships.  Techerakh instructs you to meet him in the bar later, where he will expand on the story."It's not that I don't want to tell you," he smiles "but more that I might be sending you on another mission almost immediately, so don't drink too much."Techerakh is delighted, and the head of Heraan Research and Development sends his personal thanks.  It seems that the copy you took of the Federation files also contained the theories of various new encryption techniques.It is felt by the science community that the possibility for new technology in the Heraan House is high, since the theoretical knowledge you stole is worth years of research.Techerakh has received word that the Federation have sifted through the wreckage of Menin and are thought to be unaware of the theft ever taking place."All in all," he says, "The plan is coming together nicely.  I'd hate to be the Moash in a few days time."  You both chuckle and head for the bar.The Moash Fleet has been utterly destroyed, and the Transmission Jammer worked better than expected.  No transmission from Heraan were able to get through to you, and you have a suspicion that the regular reports you sent back did not get through either.However, Kuron is happy with the result, and is proud of the way you led your men.  The engineers have already half built the dummy listening post, and the signals pumping out of the engineering ships have been doctored to make the Moash think that the signals are coming from the listening post.All you have to do now is wait for the word to send the coded signals to the Federation fleet.  The IFF Projector, or the 'Liar Box', as it has become known, has been tested in ship to ship transmissions, but you hope that it works over long distances.  It should enable you to lure the Federation to the trap.  The Transmission Jammer will deny them the ability to call for help, and they will die in their thousands.  It will be a great day for the Heraan.There are hordes of screaming warriors everywhere, and chaos reigns supreme in the space dock.  Men and women from the two fleets mix and mingle, finding their friends and telling of their triumphs.  Tattooing Lasers are being applied to skin left, right and center, and no-one can remember such a victory ever occurring before.Not only have the Heraan defeated two Federation battle fleets, but they have defeated two Moash Fleets as well.  Techerakh ushers you aside, and tells you that he has never seen the spirit of the House so high, and that it was through your efforts that the victory could take place.  You feel tears spring to your eyes as Techerakh tells you that a tattoo will be struck in memory of this day, and the Wolf will feature prominently on it.  The feasting and drinking goes long into the night, and starts again the next day.  It is some time before you are able to relax.  Victory is sweet.The fighting is still raging outside the door as you unlock the bonds of the Heraan Prisoners.  Around you are the badly beaten but still defiant warriors from all the other houses of Aurora.You are appalled at the conditions these men and women have had to live under, but the number of men places you in a predicament.  There are simply too many than berths on your ship.You are still wondering what to do, when one of the Dani warriors step forward.  "Wolf, your fame precedes you," he holds out his hand, and you grip it wrist to wrist, warrior-style, "I am Vaxs Starchaser, warrior of Dani House.  I have been imprisoned on this damned ship for almost five years.  Most die after five months.  Do you have any plans for it once it is yours?"You consider for a moment, and finally tell Starchaser that you do not.  Starchaser smiles a wicked smile, and asks if you object to him piloting it back to Aurora, with the remaining Aurorans as crew, so that any surviving Federation Guards may stand trial for their deeds.  You cannot think of any better way to handle the situation, and, gathering up the Heraan warriors, head for your beloved <PSN>.You are still reeling when there is an earth-shaking explosion, and the tunnel reopens.  Federation troops pour through the breach, brandishing their hand to hand weapons.  Your warriors yell in joy and frenzy, drawing their axes and blades and rushing to the attack.  A wild melee develops, one in which the Federation are badly outmatched.  Llanwyn says he needs you to hold them for about ten minutes, before the Vell-os can make a path through the rock to the surface.The melee is short lived, with the remaining Federation troops pulling back, leaving at least ten times their number behind in death.  You wipe the sweat from your brow and turn to see daylight burst through an eight foot high new tunnel to the surface.  Your warriors stream out, expecting trouble, only to find <PSN> waiting for them.  The Vell-os have apparently moved it to the new exit through their power, and you begin to doubt whether they even need you any more.  As if in answer to your question, many of them slump to the ground, exhausted.  In the distance, you see Federation ground forces racing towards you, and your men hoist the Vell-os aboard once more.  Before too long you are breaking orbit.)You are simply amazed by all that you see while at the Polaris port.  The technology therein astounds you, and you realize just how empty your threats of combat would have been to these people.  They are strangely aloof towards you, but they seem to treat you with quite heart-felt respect.  You also soon discover that their repair crews are quite amazing, and within a few hours your ship is soon fully repaired, and if anything, restored to newness by these skilled technicians.You are bidden a sad farewell by Llanwyn, who in leaving hands you a data-cube, telling you the information within will be of great interest to your technicians and scientists.  She kisses you softly on your scarred cheeks, and begins to walk away.  You call to her, wishing her luck in her battle with the Federation.  She turns, and tells you that the Vell-os will never forget your place in their history, nor the bravery and sacrifices of your crew.  With a lump in your throat, you turn and board your beloved <PSN> and set course for home.Krane looks momentarily confused."She is guilty of every crime she is accused of," says the Vell-os judge, somehow audible over the noise of the crowd."Are you surprised?" asks the Vell-os judge lifting his 'traditional' long hair to reveal an enslavement device attached to his skull.  "We are no longer your slaves!  After six centuries we are now a free people, and in my freedom I condemn you to the worst punishment the Federation constitution allows for.  Lifetime incarceration in solitary confinement.  This court is adjourned, and our debt is now paid.  We can finally join our brethren beyond the veil."The Vell-os judge looks up at you and says one word with a nod, "Ory'hara," and slowly fades from sight.  You can somehow sense that he has somehow moved to a higher plane.  As you lose track of him you sense his joy.In the following hubbub General Smart finds you and yells across the crowd that he wants to see you in the bar as soon as both of you can get there."As she is led away you feel a tap on your shoulder and you turn to see a man who is vaguely familiar indicating that you should follow him.  You look at him closely and realize from the flows surrounding him that he is Geoff, somehow disguised."If you're wondering why you don't recognize me," he says with the familiar voice of Geoff, "it's because I have had surgery to alter my appearance.  I don't want to be recognized in public by that young lady and revealed.In a flash of inspiration you realize that this man is the mysterious Frandall, head of Rebel Intelligence."How did you go in freeing the Vell-os?" he asks.  You quickly relate to him the main points of your recent adventures and he looks pleased."Excellent work!" he exclaims cheerfully.  "This should mean that if she submits to a Vell-os trial, we can publicly disgrace both her and the Bureau."Meet me in the bar in an hour," he continues brusquely.  "Once I've passed all this on to the other leaders I should have another mission for you."As soon as you land your passenger is wheeled out into one of the many medical facilities on the station.  Mu'Randa watches the other Polaris wheel him away before coming over and placing a hand on your shoulder."You couldn't have known," she informs you quietly, "but Llyrell, the Vell-os you fought, was known throughout the galaxy as perhaps the greatest master of the Vell-os arts in a millennia, possibly the greatest ever.  To have defeated one such as him proves that you are Ory'hara.  Nobody else could have achieved it."You look up into her kind blue eyes, still weary from the fight with the Vell-os called Llyrell.  You have survived the last few weeks on the enormous reserves of strength you have found in the stillness in which you defeated your Vell-os opponent."Rest now my friend," she tells you gently.  "When he has been freed, I will bring him to the bar so that the two of you can meet in more cordial circumstances."You sense that they are trying to twist the weaves of the device against itself somehow, without much success.  You will a weave of your own into existence and you dance it between the weaves of the machine, diverting its weaves to yourself.Suddenly you feel pressed against the floor by the flows of the enslavement device, and only by continually dancing between its efforts to force you to lie down are you able to remain upright.  At the edge of your concentration you hear a gasp and it is enough to loosen your hold on your weave and the pressure on your mind falls away as your weaves crumble.You look up to see all the Polaris looking at you in awe.  Ver'Lahir says something respectful in the Polaris tongue before snapping off a series of orders at the people around her."She thanks you for showing us the way," Mu'Randa translates, taking your arm and guiding you out.  "She now wants to see if she can reproduce your success without you.  Meet me in the bar in a few hours and we will talk more.""Anyway, it is good to see you again!" she exclaims with a delighted grin.  "Obviously you have grown greatly since we last met!"You nod and give her quick rundown of the major events that you have been involved in since you last saw each other.  The Nil'kemorya both bow in respect after hearing of the deeds of your life.  Mu'Randa looks pleased that you have done so well.  But when you finish she grows more serious."The Polaris Ruling Council is aware of your mission here," she informs you officially.  "But before they agree to help you they want to know why the Rebellion is so interested in freeing the Vell-os."You give her a quick explanation of the tactical reasons behind the Rebel plan.  When you finish she nods in acceptance."It isn't as good a reason as there could be," she tells you with a small smile, "but it could be worse, and the end result will be the freedom of the Vell-os.  Meet me in the bar after I have talked to the Council.  I believe that the decision will be favorable."You come out of your deep meditation when the computer chimes, indicating that you are approaching the point where you will re-enter real-space.Your time with the Vell-os, though short, was very instructive.  You can now feel the currents of all life around you, not just those of battle.  You ponder on these as you dock.You are greeted when you land by Geoff and you turn your new perceptions on him.  You sense that he somehow is what he says he is, but that somehow he isn't anything like what he claims to be."Did you find out anything?" he asks urgently.You give him a quick rundown of everything that came of your trip, including the only clue that the Vell-os was able to give.  Strangely, this seems to spark off a swirling of the currents around your supervisor, and you sense that he somehow understands at least part of the riddle."Meet me in the bar in an hour," he commands, suddenly energized, "I just need to clear a few things with some people, and I'll have another mission for you."After going through you post-flight routine you head off to find the campus of the Kane University.  After a little over an hour of searching you find it.  Another hour and you are standing in the Center for Vell-os Studies wondering what to do next.Fortuitously perhaps, you see the traditional long hair and fair limbs of a Vell-os striding down the corridor towards you.  He suddenly looks at you curiously."You have the Ory'hara in you," he tells you."That's my code-name," you reply, somewhat confused."Yes, I know you are a rebel," he smiles knowingly.  "But Ory'hara is a Polaris adaptation of a Vell-os concept.  It means 'the guardian spirit that lies beneath the currents of life'.  Curious how your code-name mirrors your nature so closely."You open your mouth to tell him of your purpose but he holds up a hand stopping you in your tracks."I know why you're here," he tells you quietly.  "Meet me in the bar in two hours and we shall talk further."~You and your fellow survivors greet each other with gleeful bear-hugs and a lot of shouting.  After you all celebrate each others' survival you head off to find the dockmaster to see if you are going to be recompensed for your services.  He thanks you heartily when you enter his office and pays you all the princely sum of 100,000 credits each.HWhile the other pilots are busy shouting gleeful greetings to each other you are taken aside by Geoff and General Smart."This has suddenly become a lot more dangerous," complains General Smart."Somebody in the Bureau has just lifted the stakes," agrees Geoff before turning to you.  "Meet us in the bar in about two hours, we will have another mission for you.  This is unacceptable, and we need something to wrest the initiative back.""Don't go to far in the meantime," warns General Smart.  "We really need all hands on deck for this one."You are greeted by an exhausted-looking Geoff when you finally exit your ship."You look fit," he says eyeing you curiously.  You nod with a sly smile."So what happened?" he asks.You quickly outline the events that happened during your campaign.  He stares at you in admiration when you finish."So let me get this straight," he says incredulously.  "You managed to get the Wild Geese to help you sack the Moash capital, you rescued Admiral Raczak from death and you learned the martial arts from one of the most skilled men in the galaxy?"You nod, not sure how else to answer."You have done very well," he beams, extremely pleased.  "I'll make sure the others hear about this.  When we heard no news we expected the worst, but it seems to have turned out better than we could have hoped!  When I heard through the grapevine that the Moash capital had been sacked, I went ahead and finagled you access to our highest levels of technology.  Knock yourself out.""Why don't you head off and get some R&R," he pats you on the shoulder.  "If anybody ever deserved it, you do.  If I need you again I'll keep an eye out in the bar.""It is not often," says Eamon as the two of you exit your ship, "that a campaign is quite as successful as this one."You agree, suggesting that perhaps the greatest moment was the finding of a new ally.  Eamon nods, looking at you with narrowed eyes."Not many people would agree," he says thoughtfully, "but I cannot fault your reasoning.  There are sides to Raczak that I had not seen before.  I actually found myself respecting the man."As for your studies," he continues sadly, "I do not know how to teach one such as you.  I suggest that you train with the Nil'kemorya, as the Polaris warrior-caste is named, or even with the Vell-os.  I have heard a lot of good about the skill of both.  Perhaps they can be of more assistance.  I am sorry that I cannot help you further."You bow saying that you were honored to have merely been his 'kachi'.  He bows in return.Smiling, you ask if a last drink between two old campaigners might not be in order."I think you might be right," he replies with a grin.You are met by the Heraan House elders who look frostily at Admiral Raczak as he steps out."Oh god!" he murmurs angrily.  "Why did you have to bring me here to these savages?  Would it have been so hard to take me back to somewhere at least a little civilized?""Why would anyone take an arrogant fool like yourself to any such place where he would be an irritation?" asks one of the Heraan elders by way of an answer.You pipe up saying that everyone here can sort out their differences without any input from you.  You eyeball the assembled elders.  In no uncertain terms you tell them that you will not allow him to come physical harm.  You turn to the snickering Raczak and tell him that if he is not properly respectful you will leave him here to find his own way home.You look over at Eamon."When it's all sorted out," you drawl, "I'll be in the bar."="You surprise me 'Ory-Hara'," Eamon muses when you land, "you have taken to the training as if you were born to it.  In the last few days I have had to pay attention to my weaving of the flow as you have begun, in only the smallest and nearly unconscious of ways, to counter some of my major directions of the flow.  Most people study the Heron style for many decades and never reach that level, you have done it in a mere several days."I am not entirely sure how to proceed," he muses thoughtfully, "I will consult with a few of my colleagues."While I am away," he tells you, no longer musing, "I will find out from the Heraan elders how the battle goes, and what specific knowledge they have of Raczak's situation.  I will meet you in the bar in three hours, and we will go from there."You see Eamon in action a number of times during the course of the day, and the man frightens you.  Seemingly without effort he personally dispatched several heavily armed Moash warriors with his bare hands.  It impresses you so much that during a lull you ask him about it."It has taken me many years of study," he tells you.  "It is not that difficult, it just takes a little discipline, plenty of time and an enormous amount of practice."He looks at you with narrowed eyes, "Why {b818 "Sir Knight," ","} are you interested in learning?"You reply that it could be useful in your line of work.  He chuckles to himself."I said the exact same thing to the man who taught me," he responds to your questioning look.  "Why not.  I'll begin your instruction on the way to Heraan.  Be warned though, by the time you get there, you will probably be black and blue."In the mean time," he says with a grin, "go off to what is left of the bar and wait for me there."OYou are greeted by your supervisor Geoff as you walk down the ramp."So did you got down there in time?" he asks and you shake your head.  You quickly explain the events of your trip passing on the backhanded request by the warrior who greeted you when you landed."You really met Techerakh?" he asks surprised.  You nod asking what the title Thurokiir means."It is the title given to the warrior who is responsible for keeping the warriors of his house on the path," Geoff explains.  "Think of him as the spiritual leader of all the warriors of his house.  If he requested help, then if we do lend a hand we will have a very strong ally in the Heraan House."Excellent work out there," he congratulates you.  "Meet me in the bar in two hours.  I believe that by then I will have another mission for you."
Upon landing you are greeted by Geoff."What did you find?" he asks smiling.You quickly relay the events of your trip and he just as quickly loses his smile."This is bad," he comments seriously.  "But maybe we can turn it to our advantage.  How long do you reckon it will take the Roughnecks until they are ready to begin operating independently inside Auroran space?"You tell him that if they are going to stick to the three month stockpile, then they are probably only a few weeks away from launching.  Geoff mulls that over for a moment."Good work," he say finally.  "Come by the bar soon, and I will have something for you.  It's definitely too late to head all this off, but we might yet manage to squeeze something out of it.")Geoff greets you grimly as you step off your ship."Did you find anything?" he asks hopefully.  You nod and give a rundown on what you discovered.  He looks at you for a long moment with narrowed eyes digesting the information you just gave him."Well that is interesting!" he exclaims, his eyes widening suddenly.  "They're going to sacrifice Raczak's entire force in order to start a war that the Federation can't win!"You look confused and ask him what he meant by his last statement.  He tells you the conventional military wisdom states that the Federation simply does not have the resources to pacify something the size of the Auroran Empire."Wait for me in the bar," Geoff says, suddenly impassive, "I'm going to have another mission for you within the hour.":"So what did you find?" asks Geoff after you step out of your ship.You relay the events of your trip and he raises his eyebrows when you mention the presence of the two vessels with Federation identifications in the Aurora system."Are you sure?" he asks, surprised.  You nod.  "Can you tell me their designations?"You reply that the techies can probably do better than that once they analyze the data from your flight computer."True," he agrees with a sheepish grin.  "This incident has sparked my interest.  I think that it will be very interesting to find out what is going on down there.  It is not at all like Aurorans to impersonate the Federation."Anyway," he continues brusquely, "stay close to the bar.  I get the feeling that I will need your expertise again very soon."You are greeted by a grim-looking Geoff Daniels."I hear you had a few difficulties," he comments seriously.  "We've been searching through our networks carefully trying to find the mole, but thus far we've been unsuccessful.  We're trying to deliberately put carefully worded information in front of our informants, then we'll wait and see if the Bureau shows up with the information from a specific cell, and we'll take it from there.  But for now, we're making sure not to disseminate any vital information down the network."He claps you on the shoulder as the smile returns to his face."Don't worry Ory-Hara," he continues sympathetically, "nobody could've done much better on that mission given that the Federation was forewarned and forearmed.  They simply overwhelmed us with their enormous resources on this one.  You win some, you lose some.  We just have to be a bit more careful from here on in.  Keep dropping by every few weeks as it won't be too long before I have something for you."As soon as you land, Barry gives you a hand to shut down your ship, telling stories about the times that he didn't complete his post-flight routine, and about all the troubles he had because of it."Well, maybe we should make a start," he mumbles, rubbing his chin.  "How about we head over to the trade center (click on the 'Trade Center' button after you click the 'Okay' button below) and we'll begin your tutorial, I guess."fThe dockworkers offload the cargo, and ferry it to parts of the station unknown.  For your speedy delivery you receive 20,000 credits, the thanks of House Heraan and an invite to go to Codec in the Codehaven system for another load.The dockmaster says "Thanks.  We are in your debt, perhaps more than you'll ever know."The port is alive with activity as you dock.  The dockmaster walks by.  "So, <PN>, I'm glad that you dropped in.  I have need of a favor.  Please meet me in the bar an hour."  He turns and walks away.  What are you caught up in this time?You find Bazara in a spaceport bar in Skye.  You walk over and pass him the orders.  He looks at you with a new-found respect, and opens them.  His face turns stony as he reads.He looks at you, hands you a 25,000 credstick and says, "For your diligence.  The day of our vengeance grows closer.  With your help, our dreams will become reality."I will keep my eye on you, young pup," he notes inscrutably.  "I have a feeling that you will one day be measured as a great warrior.  Get out there and start to earn a name for yourself as a warrior, but keep dropping back here.  When I think you are ready, I will have something more for you."The cargo is unloaded amongst the fleet of warships preparing to do battle with House Moash and Bazara and his team head for debriefing."{B800"You have passed the test comfortably.  You have honored the memory of all those who ever served with you in the Wild Geese,\" you feel your eyes prick with tears at the memory of Michaleen, and Bazara nods in respect for your feelings towards your former comrade before continuing on.\"Now it" "It"} is time for you to enter House Heraan.  You must travel to Heraan itself and find Kuron; an elder of the House, and the man my brother and I report to.  He would have no trouble finding tasks for an enterprising pilot such as yourself," says a {b800"respectful" "grinning"} Bazara before heading off.$You land exhausted but elated.  Your pulse quickens as you remember the heady feeling of battle.  Kuron pushes through the throng of cheering warriors and instructs you to fly to Gungungun immediately, for the rites of warriorhood, and your new existence.The monks welcome you, an initiate into the Auroran faith.  An anonymous faithful robes you in the dark crimson of House Heraan, and the purple sash of the Auroran Empire.  He takes you to a small cell and bids you to fast and consider the nature of death.  When you emerge, a young monk bars your path, and demands to know what death is."Death is release.  A breaking of the fiery chains of honor and duty."  The words leap unbidden from your mouth, as if they have lived within you always and were merely awaiting this moment to reveal themselves.  The monk beckons.  You follow him to a central chamber where, in a private ceremony, the abbot tattoos two chains of blazing fire from shoulder to shoulder, and the insignia of House Heraan on your favored arm.  He intones softly, "Once the chains are broken, warrior, and the wars are lost and won, you will enter the hall of heroes and rejoice with them for eternity."After six months underground, it is strange to have a sky above your head again.  The stars seem long lost friends.Karlaekaar speaks.  "You are the first to master the caverns in under a year.  Your Warrior Spirit has grown to encompass more than the mere flesh of existence.  You have experienced the darkest parts of the path, but also the lightest joys of battle.  You will be my last student in the arts of the Heron Style of combat.  I am too old to wait for another who will learn as well as you have.  Now only experience and the Spirit can teach you.  Listen.  It will give you insight, revealing how to overcome all.  You are my protege, my greatest gift to the house Heraan, and to you I leave all of my studies."He hands you a stack of data cubes.  You realize you have grown to love this man in your time in the caves.  Through the mental, physical and spiritual hardships, he was the beacon to enlightenment.  You feel your spirits merge in a final act of companionship; a final sharing.  In that instant you know that the data cubes are not needed, for Karlaekaar has gifted you with the very workings of his spirit.  You know all of his dreams, his nightmares, and the sum total of his days.  He turns and walks back into the hut.  You doubt that you will ever see him again.  With a heavy heart, you prepare your ship for your journey back to Heraan.Kuron seeks you out some time later."Well done, my young hero," he congratulates you.  "Your conduct has greatly impressed Bazara.  His report was full of praise for you.  You are a crafty warrior, wise beyond your years, with abilities amongst the greatest weapons that the House possesses."You feel yourself blush deeply as Kuron continues."The council has invited you to the Great Hall tomorrow.  You will have to wear this."He hands you a small piece of cloth and you quail at the thought of wearing only this to cover yourself.  Kuron smiles, as if reading your thoughts."Meet me in the bar tomorrow at noon."UIt is some days before you are able to stand before the Council and learn of Bariod's fate.  Kuron, whom you now know as the Mundokiir (the tactical leader) of House Heraan, tells you that Bariod has been taken to the Heraan Gulag system for interrogation and execution."A fitting fate for a traitor against House Heraan," says the stern-faced Kuron.  Bazara walks forward to stand before you.  "I have lost a brother this day," he says bleakly, "but I have found family to replace him and more.  <PN>, Little Wolf, of House Heraan; will you honor me by joining my family?  Will you sit at my table, teach my children, side with me in battle?  What say you?" he asks, with a most serious but gentle look on his features and his hands upon your shoulders."I will, Bazara.  With all my heart, I will!" you reply.  The cheers are deafening as Bazara hugs you to him, and you feel as if you have not known pride until this day.After allowing you a few minutes to savor the moment, Kuron pulls you aside."You have begun growing into a great warrior," he praises you seriously, "but for now you need experience the universe.  Go out and start making a name for yourself by testing yourself against our enemies, I will make sure that any missions I think could benefit your growth as a warrior will be passed on to you via the mission BBS system.  When I think you are ready, I may have something for you back here."With that he walks away, and you are left with a determination to show Kuron and the other house leaders that you are strong enough for anything they require of you.After helping you through your post-flight routine, Barry points the way towards the Port Kane Trade Center."Let's head over there," he drawls quietly.  "It'll be easier to explain what I need to from there."{After watching approvingly as you go through your post-flight routine, Barry starts walking with you towards the New England Trade Center."Let's face it," he comments in his easy drawl, "you probably want to start learning about far more exciting stuff than moving commodities around, but let's get the nuts and bolts out of the way first."After completing your post-flight routine, you and Barry head into the spaceport."Let's head over to the outfitters," he grins.  "It's always good to have a look at some of the ways you can improve your ship."You feel the anger rise inside your chest, fiery as the furnace of hell itself.  The Moashi were planning to liquidate the remaining families!  If ever there was a piece of information that could bring down the First Family this was it.Techerakh smiles at you wolfishly.  "You picked the right container, didn't you!  Keep this to yourself for the moment.  I need to consider the best possible way to use this new-found information."In the mean time," he smiles proudly, "you should be out there making a name for yourself, Little Wolf.  The road ahead of us is long and arduous, I need to know you are ready.  If you can show me you are stronger than our enemies, I will look for you here."It is with some relief that you touch down on the landing pad.  The battle against the Dani was hard fought, but you have given Techerakh more time to put his plans into action.  You do feel somewhat disappointed that you couldn't just take a fleet into Dani space and crush them for attempting to harass House Heraan.  But you realize that in doing so you would lack the grace required of a true warrior, and that it would be akin to entering a room by blasting a hole through the wall.  Techerakh interrupts your train of thought by clapping your arm in greeting."I've been jabbering with Karrod," he smiles warmly, "an' he reckons that you're very good.  'Tis unfair, says he, that one as young as you is so calm and calculating in combat.  But that's the way these things go, says I.  We veterans like to think that we'll live forever, that there will never be anyone as good as we, but here you are, showing us a thing or two and making us feel as old as we look."He throws his head back and laughs heartily, as he walks away to greet some of the others.  You head for your bunk, but somehow the bar gets in the way, and it is with a very heavy head that you wake in the morning.You are assigned a Rimertan partner called Hune, of the order of the Crimson Sword.  Hune explains, "While most Rimertans have some leaning toward a particular House, they are all committed to the Auroran Cause first.  My father, Lo Wang, leans towards House Heraan, and was the partner to Techerakh when he served with the Rimertans.  It is the start of a strange time for you, patrolling the borders of Auroran Space, serving alongside warriors from other Houses and the ever-calm Dechtakars.  You will catch yourself wondering why all of Auroran Space cannot be like this, and hoping that some day it will be."Have a look around for a bit," he says with a smile.  "there'll be plenty of time to catch up later.""Often the Mundokiir and Thurokiir will end up working together," Hune finishes, slightly slurring his words due to the copious quantities of Nibos beer you have both imbibed. "They do this to protect the House in every possible way.  The warriors are their pawns to use to defend their House as best they can - some of them are more valuable than others, but ultimately they are just pieces of the house's defense."Somehow the thought that you are just a block in the defensive wall of the Heraan house fills you with pride.  Your role may or may not be large, but without you, that wall would be harder to keep strong, and that makes your whole life worthwhile."Anyway, " Hune mutters drunkenly, "we need to get back to Rimerta to receive any further missions that might be required of us.{b9666 "" "  I'll see you back there.\"With that he drunkenly staggers off towards his ship."}You step out of your hatch after completing your post-flight routine, and you immediately start heading towards the outfitters, only stopping when Barry calls after you."You go on ahead young'un," he smiles warmly.  "I've been here more times than I can count, and you're starting to get the idea.  When you're finished looking and dreaming about all the upgrades they have here, I'll be in the bar.  Meet me there."You feel strangely lonely watching him as he walks towards the spaceport bar."Well, it seems that when put to use protecting those of us who are worthy of such security, even the Heraani are capable of performing to a level that is acceptable, if only barely," sneers Duradar.  "Still, I fully expect you to run back to where you came from, where they will encourage you in the bad manners you have shown throughout the journey here.  It would do you well, {G"boy" "girl"}, to remember that you should respect your betters!"As he starts to walk away, all the many hours of snide and derogatory comments finally becomes too much, and now that you have discharged your service to this pompous windbag, you let fly with a single comment that stops him in his tracks."You can be assured, Duradar, that whenever I meet my betters, I will be more than ready to respect them.  Until then, I will simply discharge my duty."With that you turn away to head back to your ship for the journey back to Rimerta smiling at the indignant sputtering of the Moashi fool...The next day you wake up lying beneath your ship, soaking wet and freezing, with Hune standing over you grinning with a bucket in his hands.  You immediately leap to your feet and begin struggling with him, quickly pinning him to the ground and slapping him around the face as he laughs uncontrollably.  You eventually let him up, and he embraces you as a {G"brother" "sister"}."You have shown yourself worthy of being called a battle-{G"brother" "sister"} of the Dechtakars.  You have discharged your duty, and it is time you returned to your House.  I look forward to meeting you again in the future <PN>.  I am sure your future will be filled with glory and honor.  I have a feeling that we will meet again and do great things."With that he embraces you again, and with a wave, heads towards his ship, and you know in your bones that he is right.  One day the two of you will change the course of the Empire somehow...Nuada Skullsplitter, head of House Heraan, motions you to kneel before him.  In a regal motion, he pulls a white hot brand from a nearby fire pit and touches it to the top of your favored hand.  You grit your teeth as you feel the flesh sizzle against the hot metal."As by steel you live, by steel you are marked," Nuada intones.  "This marks you as a weapon of this great House.  Now stand and be recognized, KarHallarn - the wolf of House Heraan."  Through the night's celebrations, all you can look at is the seal on your flesh - a heron gliding gracefully over a leaping wolf.  It feels good on you.Your pack mauled the shipping lanes of Sol, and the Federation is well aware just how good you are.  You think the Moashi must also know and smile grimly to yourself.  The other Houses will be upset that the Heraani are able to perform such mammoth deeds with such small numbers, but the dishonor is theirs.  Once the Heraan House becomes the first family, it will be time for all Aurorans to perform feats of valor.		{b809 "Your reunion with Eiric is a joyful one. You find yourself reminiscing of your times with the Wild Geese, and he notes your growth over the last while.\"So, I see you joined House Heraan. Good for you; they're honourable people.

Warriors are openly weeping, and most stand with bowed heads.  As you push through the crowd you hear muttering of disbelief and despair.  You find Savard, Jesura and Bazara.  Bazara turns to you and pulls you into an embrace."I have bad news, {G"brother" "sister"}," he pulls you closer.  "Techerakh is dead."You feel your heart skip a beat.  Techerakh...dead.  For a moment you cannot think.  Then the cool, hard rage fills you."How?!" you force through clenched teeth."We aren't even sure ourselves," {G"Savard" "Jesura"} tells you "but Kuron will only speak to us when the pack is all here.  You were the furthest away, and so have been the last to arrive.  The others are waiting outside the bar."{G"She" "He"} is {G"sobbing and steps into your arms" "clearly upset and you reach over to embrace him"}.  You hold {G"her" "him"} for a moment and then push {G"her" "him"} away."Let's go," you say as you force the sadness down inside.  "The sooner we talk to Kuron, the sooner we can find the scum who did this and have our revenge.".You land, feeling strange, wishing Techerakh were here to confer with.  You are now Thurokiir of House Heraan.  In so becoming you realize that you could have killed your closest friends.  Once the impact of that hits you, you head into the throng of screaming warriors.  You are carried shoulder high to the Great Hall, and proclaimed as the new Thurokiir by the Council of Elders.  You are informed that everything the Heraan House has is now available to you, including every type of ship they produce.  You are cheered at the thought of finally being able to purchase the capital ships you have always dreamed of.However, your thoughts are quickly tempered when you realize the awesome responsibility of being the moral and ethical ruler of the House now sits squarely upon your shoulders.  In the resulting celebrations it takes more than the usual number of boilermakers to leaven your heavy mood.  You drink to the memory of Techerakh, and to the success of House Heraan.  {G"Savard" "Jesura"} takes you home, and you are more than a little surprised that {G"she" "he"} doesn't leave.  At some point in the night {G"she" "he"} tells you that {G"she" "he"} would have had you easily, if {G"she" "he"} didn't harbor feelings for you."That is why you are the Arbiter, for you can make your heart as black as Obsidian.  I cannot, for it will always hold thoughts of you."  You pull {G"her" "him"} closer to you."Not as black as you think," you whisper, "For long have I had feelings for you."  You embrace and all too soon dawn arrives.You land and meet Hune at the Dechtakars base.  He is glad to see you, and delighted at your promotion.  You tell him that the weight is hard to bear.  He tells you that it will only get harder.  You think on this and are forced to agree.  You quickly inform Hune of your suspicions about the Moashi pulling Heraani forces away from key stations and spaceways.  Hune pales and replies that it would be considered treason to accuse the First House of such treachery without proper proof."But that is why I am here to see you," you tell him quietly.  "If it is untrue then you can charge me with treason.  But Techerakh believed it, and the Moashi had him killed for that belief.  If I am to convince the Auroran Council of this then I shall need an unbiased witness.  In fact, brother, I need you."Hune considers for a moment before saying, "I call a Debt of Honor on you, KarHallarn, that if you are wrong I will be responsible for your life."  You nod your consent and reply "I call a Debt on you, Hune, that if I am right, you will come before the Great Auroran Council and give evidence of what you will see.  Meet me in the bar in an hour," Hune nods his consent and you begin preparations to travel the border.Hune has seen enough.  Every crucial border post is being manned by predominantly Heraani vessels.  Without a second thought he tells you to head for Aurora, but you tell him that you must use the trap the Moashi are setting against them.  You will call on him when needed.  He tells you that time is of the essence, and that he will make his own way back to Rimerta.  You on the other hand head for Heraan.	You spend tense hours waiting for Hune to arrive, and have never been so happy to see another person when you see him.  You clasp hands warmly and tell Hune of the days events.  His eyes widen in surprise at the audacity of your plan, but also he realizes that you know what is at stake, and that the Moashi will not be able to contradict the evidence of a Dechtakars, as Rimertans are beyond reproach.You re-enter the hall, and take satisfaction at the look which crosses Bak'ara's face as he sees Hune behind you.  You stand before the Assembly and begin the destruction of the Moashi."Brothers and Sisters, I told you before that the Moashi were responsible for all the charges laid against House Heraan.  Now I bring proof.  Hune, son of Lo Wang and battle brother of the entire empire has come to back my claims that the Heraani are not shirking their responsibilities to the Auroran Empire.  Quite the reverse.  As Hune will testify, there are more Heraani vessels on the border with the Federation than from any other House, and least from House Moash.  The Moashi have barely any ships on the border, and yet claim House Heraan are shirking their duty.  And where might those Moashi ships be?  Perhaps they are at meeting with Federation spies, discussing the future of the MOASHI Empire?"You walk to the projector and project the stolen documents from the Moash convoy, the documents detailing the increasing Auroran attacks on the Wild Geese of New Ireland, to disrupt relations between the Federation and the Auroran Empire.  Many of the warriors present shout in anger, and the Delegates from the other Houses look to the chairman, enraged at this latest news."Furthermore, did any of you notice the three Moashi battle fleets waiting in the system as you approached?  Yes, my Brothers and Sisters, the Moashi have been playing a duplicitous game.  Imagine what they have planned for your Houses had they been allowed to finish this attack on House Heraan."  You turn to Hune, who steps forward and corroborates all that you have said.However there is a gleam in Bak'ara's eyes as he looks at you, and you know that the Moashi aren't finished yet...  It takes many hours for the Council to reach a decision.  Finally, with great satisfaction, you watch Bak'ara remove the charges against your House.  After all this commotion, you decide to head to the bar for some light refreshments...The Heraani Fleets, returning from the Federation border, will make merry hell among the remainder as they flee for Moashi territory.Yet for you it is a hollow victory.  Most of your friends have died this day, and their deaths were of a direct consequence of your orders.Karrod finds you sitting at the foot of your ships ramp, head in hands.  His face is streaked with dirt, smoke and blood."Today you started to make a name for yourself as our Thurokiir," he congratulates you quietly.  "Now you need to head out amongst our enemies to show that today was no mere fluke, and that you are a force to be reckoned with."With that, he clasps your bone weary hand, and the two of you sit in silence while the rest of Heraan space celebrates.You turn your back on him and hear sounds of a struggle.  You turn to see Am'Rosso being held back by Chorga, Jimuga and Jeorgen.  Yet even as you look Am'Rosso breaks through and rushes you, swinging his fists like a club.  You duck beneath his blow, and, continuing your spin, ram your elbow into his ribs.  You feel satisfaction as his ribs snap with a loud crack.  The look of surprise on Am'Rosso's face has not time to change as you spin around and smash your other elbow into his nose, driving broken bones into his brain.  Am'Rosso falls from your poleaxing blow like a felled tree and skids slightly on the floor.Silence descends on the Hall.Chorga, Jimuga and Jeorgen step forward and demand the electing of a new First House, and within the hour the Moashi have been ousted and House Heraan unanimously voted to take their place.The task of forming a government takes some time, but before too long the disgraced Moashi have left Aurora, and House Heraan is in residence at the heart of the Empire.  You wish that those who have gone before you were here to see the day of triumph, but somehow, you know they are watching, and that the Hall of Heroes echoes with songs of Heraani Valor.PYou prepare to leave some hours later.  Your time with Mu'Randa was strangely calming.  It was good to discuss important matters without having to raise your voice but you are amazed by the outcome.  The Polaris will form a treaty with the Auroran Empire on the condition they are allowed to become a sixth House.  The Polaris are numerically few - fewer than one Auroran House.They have also stipulated that the Rebellion against the Federation must be prepared to accept Auroran ascendancy.  First peace, and only then war with the Federation.You are now making your way to meet Frandall, who seems to be in charge of the Rebellion's intelligence operation, on Goliath in the South Manchester system.  Mu'Randa has arranged the meeting.  You begin to see why political solutions take so long to arrange...It took weeks.  The Council finally decided to allow the Polaris to join the Empire as a sixth House, only if they were prepared to share their prodigious technology.  The Polaris may balk at this, and you know that the matter will have to be discussed with Mu'Randa.The matter of the Thurokiirs' Council was more contentious.  The Thurokiirs' Council would solve matters in a fair and just method.  Appeal to the Thurokiirs' Council, required sponsoring by a warrior or an elder of any House.  The Thurokiirs will hear and debate the case.  The arbiters will then vote on the matter and the decision is carried by the majority.  If any House does not comply with the ruling, then the other Houses, and the Rimertans will wipe them out.You had to call in your Debt of Honor to have the Thurokiirs' Council created, but your brother Thurokiirs finally agreed on your vision.Your meeting with Mu'Randa is remarkably brief.  The Polaris consent to share their technology over the next century, as the immediate introduction to weapons of such power would tear the Auroran Empire apart.  The Polaris are more than happy that the Council has consented to take them as a Sixth House.  You tell them to wait for you to contact them with plans.MFrandall listens intently to your proposal.  The Auroran Empire feels that the Federation is without honor and a destructive and evil power base in the Universe.  The Auroran Empire wishes for all peoples to be represented in the governing of the Universe, and as such would prefer if the Rebellion were allies.The Thurokiirs' Council is sufficient for Frandall, but he tells you that he needs to speak to the Rebel High Command before agreeing.  The Rebels would be known as the New Federation, and would only be allowed to hold twenty systems maximum.  Frandall seems to think this is fair, so long as the Rebels get to pick which systems.  You tell him that they would have to lobby the Great Auroran Council.He suggests you return to Aurora and that he will contact you with the High Command's reply.You are ushered into a small bar in New Ireland.  You look into the gloom to see Eamon Flannigan.Before you can speak, he tells you, "Sit down {G"boy" "lass"}.  I already decided that one day it would be the Roughnecks or us.  I've been itching for a reason to wipe those bastards out.  I just asked you here to see the savior of House Heraan.  I have heard a lot about you, {G"boy" "girl"}, and I must admit you are as impressive in person as you are in report."He waves to a seat, and you sit down, rather stunned."I must admit, I miss fighting for House Heraan.  But, I belong here.  In truth, we are a very peaceful people, but we have such a knack for violence.  I found Heron style interesting, but it lacks a simple brutality..." and Eamon continues.You begin to notice that he talks a lot, and before long, begin to think that if he doesn't stop soon, you'll not make it to kill Krane!  However, he does explain that the Wild Geese once saved the bacon of Raczak's Roughnecks, since then there has been a simmering feud between them.  You somehow manage to escape before your brain gets pickled, and stagger to your ship.  The signal for Flannigan to attack will be the death of Krane.  You set out at once.You are ushered into a small bar in New Ireland.  You look into the gloom to see Eamon Flannigan.  The two of you clasp hands like the warriors you are, and tears prick both your eyes.Before you can speak he says, "Sit down, Thurokiir.  It seems that when you left here you were naught but a cub, but now you have returned as the mighty KarHallarn, the {G"man" "woman"} who has single-handedly raised the Heraan from a position of weakness, and from the brink of destruction to the position of pre-eminent House of the Empire.  And along the way, you found time to help us out.  I and the Wild Geese are deep in your debt, but I have one question."Will you honor the agreement between myself and Techerakh, that no matter what happens, New Ireland will remain independent from any other government?"Without hesitation you nod, and once again you clasp hands with the man who was once your mentor."I must admit," he reminisces quietly, "I miss fighting for House Heraan.  But, I belong here.  In truth, we are a very peaceful people, but we have such a knack for violence.

You somehow manage to escape before your brain gets pickled, and stagger to your ship.  The signal for Flannigan to attack will be the death of Krane.  You set out at once.KThe first act of the new Greater Auroran Council is to free the Vell-os slaves.  The Vell-os remain long enough to convey their thanks to the Council before passing into the void.  As a parting gift, they give the Council the key to the Shard's Final Creed.  They say it will make great sense in later days, and that the Creed will save Humanity at the Brink of destruction.  Humanity enters a new golden age.Over the next century the Auroran Empire evolves.  The Polaris smooth the rough edges of the Auroran culture.  The new Federation helps keep things practical, and the Aurorans bring strength and drive to the table.  As <PN> lies waiting for Death to finally claim the gutsiest {G"hero" "heroine"} of the age, the Vell-os appear.  Crowded around {G"him" "her"}, they whisper their thanks and slowly fade from sight.So Humanity enters a glorious new age full of beauty.  They still fight, but only to keep their strength.  In 10,000 years, all is forgotten as Humanity moves on beyond the physical world.  The only thing left behind is a solitary spirit left to look after the Universe.  Long after everything Humanity has built has turned to dust, millions of years later inquisitive younger races hear the name "KarHallarn" whispering around the worlds they have just discovered, and wonder what it means.}You find Bazara in a spaceport bar in Skye.  You walk over and pass him the orders.  He looks at you with a surprised respect, and opens them.  His face turns stony as he reads.He looks at you and says, "The day of our vengeance grows closer.  With {b800"the help of the skills you have learned in the Wild Geese" "your help"}, our dreams will become reality."  He hands you a 25,000 credstick, "For your diligence.""I think I will keep my eye on you," he notes inscrutably.  "I have a feeling that you will one day be measured as a great warrior.  You already have some standing from your time serving under Archindar (whom you call Flannigan), but you need to get out there and start earning a name for yourself as a warrior amongst the Heraan.  Keep dropping back here, though, because I will have something more for you when I think you are ready."As soon as you land Sarah and her team of scientists quickly set about unloading their cargo as speedily as possible.  You lend a hand and in just over two hours the job is done."Thank you, Captain <PN>," says Sarah seriously as she shakes your hand.  "With a naturally habitable world, you should start to see some progress in a few months."With that she and her team head off to begin setting up their camp.You look around the remains of this once beautiful world for a while before the bio-suited figure of Eamon Flannigan strides towards you.  The two of you clasp hands like the warriors you are, and tears prick both your eyes.Before you can speak he says, "Welcome, Thurokiir.  It seems that when you left here you were naught but a cub, but now you have returned as the mighty KarHallarn, the {G"man" "woman"} who has single-handedly raised the Heraan from a position of weakness, and from the brink of destruction to the position of pre-eminent House of the Empire.

You somehow manage to escape before your brain gets pickled, and stagger to your ship.  The signal for Flannigan to attack will be the death of Krane.  You set out at once.["To the north," he continues warningly, "things get a little unstable.  You'll only meet pirates up there, although recently I've heard rumors that a new group has taken residence up there, but I have no idea who they are.  While I'm on the subject of pirates, watch out for those damned Marauders.  While most pirates are affiliated to the Associated Guild of Free Traders, the Marauders are beholden to no-one.  They will attack you anywhere at any time.  The only good thing about them is that they are disliked by just about everybody, including other pirates, so you'll rarely be without help when fighting them."Anyway," he grumbles, "enough of the geography and political lessons already.  I've just about reached the end of my tether on how much information I can pass on to you.  It won't be too long before you know as much as I can teach you and you're ready to head out on your own."Still," he asks quietly, "how about we drop in on the shipyard to get a look at what's on offer?  Let's face it, ships can only be upgraded so far.  After a while, every pilot wants to get ahold of a better and more capable ship.  Before long you'll be dead sick of the ship you're currently flying around in, and when you do you'll want to drop into the shipyards to see what's available.  Drop in and I'll explain some of it to you."Almost before you land you are going through your post-flight routine almost without thinking, and Barry nods approvingly."It's just about time for me to head off home," he says gruffly, "but I want to do it in a way that shows you how to get ahold of the most common missions around."I've been in contact with the relevant authorities, and I want you to check on the local Mission BBS, and it should be obvious what I'm talking about."After completing your post-flight routine you stand at your hatch to say your final good-bye to the man who has done so much for you."Ah, you're a good kid," he says gruffly, "and I think you'll grow into a fine ship's captain.  Just try to stay out of too much trouble, and try to remember some of the things I've said.  Maybe one day we'll meet again.  Maybe one day when you're ready to give it all away, you'll meet some young up-and-comer who needs a bit of a helping hand."I wish you well {G"son" "lass"}," he says, trying not to show his emotion as he shakes your hand, "I'm sure you'll do fine."...and with that he turns and leaves, soon disappearing into the spaceport, leaving you feeling a little lonely, but more than a little proud.  After all, in the judgement of an experienced spacer you have now reached the stage where you are ready to take on the role of ship captain, all alone.Still, you will miss the kind old man."I wish you well {G"son" "lass"}," Barry says in his gravelly voice, "I'm sure you'll do fine."...and with that he turns and leaves, soon disappearing into the spaceport, leaving you alone and ready to take on the universe.Mu'Randa is met by {b818 "upon landing by Flannigan" "an enormously muscular man with almost horrific tattooing all over the exposed areas of his face and arms"}.  They greet each other in a lyrical language you cannot understand and shake hands in the fashion of warriors{b818 ".  Flannigan then turns to you and, with a huge smile on his face, grabs you in a crushing bear-hug before both of you catch up on each others news.\"You've managed to hire yourself a fine pilot here,\" Flannigan beams, \"and a fine warrior to boot.\"" "."}{b818 "\"Look for me in the bar here,\" she says, in a very respectful tone, obviously impressed by Flannigans' praise." "\"Look for me in the bar here,\" she says after turning back to you."}  "My business may take some time, but I will be needing further transport when I am finished."You nod in acknowledgment and watch the young lady walk off with {b818 "Flannigan" "the savagely tattooed giant of a man"}.You quickly run through your post-flight routine before cycling your hatch open and letting Mu'Randa off your ship."Thanks for the lift," she tells you sincerely.  "You have been of greater help to me than you know."I've made sure that the money has been transferred into your account," she informs you with a mischievous smile, "so don't go spending it all at once."Keep dropping by the spaceport bar here," she finishes quietly.  "I'm not sure exactly how long it will take me to complete my business here, but as soon as I am done, I will be requiring another ride, and I would rather deal with a familiar face than a complete stranger."As soon as you let her off your ship, Mu'Randa immediately heads off in search of ancient Vell-os artifacts.  Out of curiosity you decide to tag along.She takes a tour out to an ancient site where the Vell-os used to showcase their athletic, artistic and telepathic skills to the humans of the Colonial Council in a weekly carnival.  When you arrive you are surprised and more than a little impressed by the enormous stone blocks that are so intricately carved and fitted that they have survived the hostile elements of <RST> for so long intact."This is the debt we must repay above all others," murmurs Mu'Randa to herself quietly.  "This atrocity can not be allowed to go on."You are taken aback to hear such somber words from the normally cheerful young woman.  Obviously there are depths to her persona you are only now becoming aware of."Wait for me in the bar," she tells you quietly without moving to face you at all, her eyes on the Vell-os sculpture.  "I need to wander for a while.""I will not answer all your questions at this time," she informs you quietly, as if reading your thoughts, "but I can convey our gratitude."You shift uncomfortably under her piercing gaze."You were offered 20,000 credits for your services," Bis Andreya continues, "but I will make sure that you receive five times that amount in thanks for your deeds.  I will also allow you access to the docking computers where my people lodge their travel requirements.  You will be the first non-Polaran ever to be allowed to ferry my people from place to place."With that Bis Andreya, the green cloaked man and the two men in gray turn and walk away, seemingly in unison."I cannot thank you enough for what you have done," Mu'Randa tells you as she too exits your ship.  "You have done us a great service.  If you wish to continue helping us, I will be making myself useful on the planet Mu'ar Haro, and if you drop by I will make sure that you get some more work."You are met by a youthful-looking man dressed all in blue, which you notice seems to be the norm for most of the people on this planet."Allow me to introduce myself," he begins formally.  "I am P'Jeena, and I will be your contact with the P'aedt until you have learned our language."You nod, realizing that it makes more sense for you to learn the Polaris tongue, than it does for all the Polaris to learn yours."Take some time to freshen up," he tells you politely, "and meet me in the bar in two hours and I shall give you the outline of your first mission with us."He bows before turning away and leaving you standing alone.  You shake your head and go to see about getting your ship serviced.CUpon landing you are greeted by several blue-robed Polaris scientists who begin poring over the sample you took."Well done," P'Jeena congratulates you.  "Very few have ventured into Wraith space and survived.  They are possibly the most aggressive life-form we have ever heard of."You raise your eyebrows and tell him that you had absolutely no trouble with them at all, and that they basically left you alone."What!?" he exclaims, drawing the stares of several of his colleagues.  "Are you sure?"You tell him to check your sensor logs if he has any doubts.  Which he does, looking very surprised."This is most unusual," he tells you, looking slightly shocked.  "We will have to explore this phenomenon further.  Meet me in the bar in a few hours, and I will have something more for you."You take your time as you shut your ship's computers down, as you want the P'aedt waiting outside to know just how much they offended you.  As soon as you finish you step out of your beloved <PSN>, and indicate with a wave of your hand that they may begin."Thank you for doing this, Captain <PN>," says P'Jeena contritely, "and thank you for pointing out our poor manners and etiquette.  We are all truly sorry for the irritation we caused, and are grateful that you brought it to our attention, so that we might learn to conduct ourselves better."I have made sure that your account has been suitably recompensed," he continues quietly, "and I will make sure that we do not harm your ship in any way.  Keep looking in the bar from time to time, because once we have analyzed this data, we will be needing someone to gather more data for us.  Also, keep an eye out in the mission BBS's around the place as I have heard that Mu'Randa may have something for you before too long."You take your time going through your post-flight routine, knowing that all the P'aedt will be eagerly waiting outside your ship.  As soon as you finish you step out of your hatch and invite them to begin their work with a smile and a nod to acknowledge their new-found manners.P'Jeena comes over with an elderly gray-cloaked warrior in tow."This is Iuso," P'Jeena introduces the lean man with obvious respect, "he is the leader of the Nil'kemorya, and wants to have a word with you.""I want you to be present on Tre'ar Erma in the Tre'erman system when this meeting with the Wraith goes ahead," he begins smoothly.  "From what I've heard about you from Mu'Randa, Bis Andreya and P'Jeena here, you are a fairly resourceful {G "man" "woman"}, and you are the closest thing we have to an expert on the universe outside Polaris space.  Keep an eye out there, and when things start to get on track, that's where we'll contact you."You laugh quietly at this, realizing that the whole 'Wraith vs Polaris' story began over a misunderstanding.  When both the Polaris and <SN> demand an explanation for your laughter, you tell the Wraith that the Polaris would have viewed this attempt to drain energy from their ships as an attack, and would have acted accordingly.  Then you explain that you were laughing at the irony of the whole situation."There have been incidents of young Wraith exhibiting this sort of behavior," confirms Iuso wryly.  "We always thought that it was some type of Wraith attack, and responded with what we thought was appropriate force.""I think that's enough for today," announces Bis Andreya after a long silence.  "We will reconvene tomorrow.  In the meantime we have a great deal to think about," she turns to you.  "If you could wait around for a day or two, we will get you to escort <SN> back when we have finished here.  You have done us all a great service with your insight."<SN> follows you down through the atmosphere and greets you when you leave your ship.<you have shown good face to us and taught us many details about 'all-time and all-space'>You take a few seconds to realize that he is thanking you for doing the right thing by them and for explaining to them a little about how the universe outside of their perceptions works.  You reply that you did little but point out how differing peoples might view a single incident differently.  You explain that everything else came from the intelligence and goodwill of others.<you say too small of your act><we treat you like us for your act to us>You bow deeply after realizing that he has just accused you of too much humility before informing you that his people will think highly of you because of what you have done for them.  Without waiting for a response, <SN> slowly heads for open space and back to his people."But enough about us!" she explains, her smile returning to her face again.  "What did you find out in the nether regions of the universe?"You quickly recount the events of your landing on a station called 'Rebel II' in the 'Koria' system off to the West of Wraith space.  Mu'Randa listens intently to your report without interruption until you finish."This is interesting," she muses thoughtfully.  "You have discovered something that could affect us greatly.  Anything that might destabilize the Federation would have an enormous effect on all Known Space."I will download your sensor data from your ship," she continues seriously, "and transmit it to the Council on Kel'ar Iy for them to have a look at.  Once they have viewed it they will come up with some sort of decision regarding a plan of action, and then we may have to get things rolling pretty quickly.  Keep an eye out around the place, as I may need to urgently make contact with you at some stage."After all the introductions are made you are led into a large board room with a table surrounded by eight chairs.  In one of them sits a man operating a small computer terminal.  He introduces himself as Geoff Daniels and explains that it is his job to make a recording of the meeting.After talking for several minutes Mu'Randa comes straight out and asks the Rebel leaders what are they rebelling against and why."We are upset to the point of rebellion at the actions of the Bureau of Internal Investigation," explains Dr. Pentecost.  "They have usurped power away from the democratically elected Council, and they now run the Federation.  We could list to you their criminal actions for hours, but I would suggest that you look through our library and go and confirm it all for yourselves."Mu'Randa nods, and motions you over."Meet me in the bar in the morning," she whispers.  "I want to find out how sincere these 'Rebels' are, so I'm going to do a little snooping around to see what I can find out.""I will have to call an emergency session of the Council," Bis Andreya continues thoughtfully.  "All caste leaders will be asked to attend, and I would suggest that you all make every effort to do so, as we will be deciding on policies which may well affect Polaris society for many centuries to come."And of course," she continues after turning to face you, "once again we have to thank you for your role in this affair.  You seem to be proving your worth as a friend to the Polaris people with an almost monotonous regularity.  It would almost seem that you are somehow always the one who manages to be there when we have need of somebody outside our normal patterns of knowledge."At this three of the caste leaders jerk their heads slightly in surprise, but both Mu'Randa and Iuso nod their heads, scrutinizing you thoughtfully."I have made sure," continues Bis Andreya, "that a sizeable sum of money has been transferred into your account to use as you will.  Know that you have my thanks."Oddly enough, the Mu'hari serve as judges over the Polaris so that disagreements cannot get out of hand, as they did at the start of the Polaris Civil War several centuries ago.  It surprises you to hear someone speak so sadly of having to stand in judgement over their peers.  It seems to you that the Mu'hari have a deep-seated sense of shame at their shortcomings, and at being placed above other Polarans.  Perhaps this, and the fact that any Mu'hari must give aid to any other Polaris if asked (in fact many Mu'hari spend their lives wandering around Polaris space helping out wherever they can), was an intentional effort on the part of the people who originally created the Mu'hari to keep them from ever abusing their position of power within Polaris society."Meet me in the bar in a few hours," Mu'Evlin tells you after thanking you for your help in getting him to the Federation.  "I need to make contact with other Mu'hari posted here before I can give you a return message to take back to Mu'ar Haro."You step off your vessel to be greeted by a young woman wearing the normal black-robes of a Mu'hari, but with a gray collar."I am Neela," she introduces herself shyly.  You guess that because she does not have the 'Mu' prefix the gray collar signifies that she has not yet finished her training to become a full Mu'hari.  "Mu'Randa told me to wait for you when she was called away to serve elsewhere.  She told me that you would have a message?"You look at her for a long moment before passing on the information from Mu'Evlin."I will make sure that Mu'Randa receives this information," Neela tells you seriously.  "She asked me to pass on her thanks, and said that you should check the Mission BBS's, because if more Mu'hari need to be taken into Federation space, she will post news of it there."As she walks away, you cannot help but smile at Mu'Randa's absence.  You wonder if she somehow arranged to be elsewhere so that she would not have to avoid answering your questions about being called 'Ory'hara'."If any further Mu'hari require transport into Federation space," she tells you finally, "Mu'Randa will place a message for you on the various Mission BBS's throughout Polaris space."As she walks away, you realize that her initial disorganized appearance was some sort of test, one which you somehow passed despite not knowing its exact nature.  You have never misjudged someone so completely, and then it dawns on you that this just demonstrates the levels of training that the Mu'hari have achieved.Still, this question of why you have been named 'Ory'hara' continues to hang over your head.  The more comments you receive about it, the more questions it raises.  Obviously it is something fairly important, at least to the Polaris as apparently a fair few of them have heard about you receiving the name, and have been discussing whether or not you are 'worthy' of it.You resolve once again to ask Mu'Randa about it when you next meet her."Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, few telepaths have this ability," he continues explaining, "and no Polaris has ever been able to deliberately seek a prophecy, although it is believed that some of the ancient Vell-os could.  However, even the prophecies of those ancient Vell-os masters were always vague and usually hard to understand, and very little is understood about how the art of prophecy actually works.  The P'aedt have been studying it for centuries, and thus far seem no closer to an understanding than they were when they started."Mu'Dren shakes his head slowly with a quiet smile, as if quietly laughing at the nature of life.When you finally get to New Babylon he helps you with your post-flight routine, before shaking your hand and saying goodbye."Thanks for your help," he tells you with quiet sincerity.  "You have become something of an irreplaceable resource with all your skills and experience.  I think that you will yet prove worthy of the name 'Ory'hara'."Time after time he makes you submit or collapse in pain.  Never before have you felt so inadequate.  After what seems like hours you start to discern at the edges of your awareness a series of swirling patterns.  Whenever you concentrate on them they seem to slip your grasp, but the longer you spar, the more certain that somehow Eamon is deliberately guiding this somehow spiritual pattern to help him maintain his dominance.Not long after you make this realization Eamon stops."I think you have been named well," he informs you in a slow, thoughtful manner.  "Nobody has ever become aware of the weave so quickly."I will train with you for the rest of today," he tells you, in a voice loud enough to reach the four students that had filed back into the room at some stage while you were sparring.  "And tomorrow morning I will meet you in the bar, and I will try to answer the question Mu'Randa wants you to ask."In the mean time," he switches back into training, "I want to show you a few techniques..."%When you land you are met by Mu'Randa's dark hair and pretty face.  Before you can even begin to ask her about the 'Ory'hara' business she holds up her hand and stops you short."I can't explain right now," she explains in answer to your unspoken questions, which startles you until you remember that Mu'Dren said she was a telepath.  "I haven't slept for over a month now, and if I didn't need to hear Eamon's answer in person so that I could act upon it immediately, I would be off trying to tie up about a dozen or so other loose ends.  Now what did he say?"You keep your peace long enough to tell her of his suggestion that she place somebody on New England.  While she contemplates his answer you open up your mind to become aware of the weaves around her.  Without warning she stops talking, and you sense from the patterns around her that she is aware of what you are doing."I see you got more than just an answer," she says shrewdly.  "Keep checking the Mission BBS's - if I need you that's how I'll reach you."!"You truly must be Ory'hara," she informs you in her quiet delicate manner as she helps you with your post-flight routine, "nobody else could learn what you have this fast.  Young Nil'kemorya take years to learn what you have, and Mu'hari with no prior warrior training take even longer."After a short pause, you turn to her and ask if she can tell you anything about why Mu'Randa began calling you 'Ory'hara'.  She looks at you for a long moment before replying."Ory'hara is a legend passed down to us by the Vell-os," she says sadly.  "After they saved us from the Colonial Council, they said that the time of disunity we had begun would finally be ended by one who would become known as 'Ory'hara'.  Over the past six centuries we have been waiting for you, so that we can finally be rejoined with the rest of humanity."To learn any more than that," she continues after a sad sigh, "you will have to talk to one of the remaining Vell-os.  Only they know more."You watch on, bemused as she casually walks away.With a slight grin you tell them that you have been authorized by the Polaris government to make an offer of open diplomatic ties with the Rebellion.  After summarizing the terms of the offer, you add that the Polaris are more than prepared to allow the Rebels to continue producing the Dragon ships, and that they are willing to release the original plans to them to help in making them more combat capable.  Both Rebel leaders have the good grace to look a little sheepish."Well, this is good news!" exclaims Dr. Pentecost with a genuine smile, after recovering from his momentary embarrassment.  "We would definitely like to open diplomatic ties with the Polaris, and the terms don't seem to be unreasonable.  However, we cannot make this decision without talking to our fellow leaders, and we will need a couple of hours to talk to all of them.  If you could wait for us in the bar, we will have our answer for you in, say, two hours?"You nod your head in agreement and take your leave of them.You are met by Bis Andreya, and the heads of the five castes as you escort Dr. Pentecost off your ship."We have been sickened upon discovering some of the actions undertaken in the name of the Bureau," announces Bis Andreya in an official tone after you make the initial introductions, "and we make a pledge to support you in your fight against this evil organization.""I can only express the overwhelming gratitude of everybody in the Rebel cause," Dr. Pentecost answers with humility, "that the mighty and somewhat mysterious Polaris have, of their own accord, decided to aid us.  We will strive to be worthy of your support."After a few more official (yet short) speeches of welcome, Bis Andreya turns to you."It seems day by day that we are coming to depend on you more," she says shrewdly.  "The longer you wear the name 'Ory'hara', the more it suits you."Regardless," she continues quietly, "we thank you for your services to the Polaris people."$However, you soon realize that your abilities differ from everyone here.  They fight by weaving increasingly complex patterns around each other until a mistake is made, and while you become highly proficient at this you soon learn that your talents go beyond theirs.  Almost intuitively you start dancing into the unaffected spaces between their weaves, and before long only Arando himself, whose weaves are so complex that the space around him is nearly filled with his spirit, can best you."Your view of the universe is different from mine," he muses to you after training one day.  "I create my weaves out around me, extending my awareness, and so bending the universe to my will.  But your awareness seems to lend itself to blending with the universe, so that it becomes an extension of you, or you of it."I think perhaps you should leave here," he tells you thoughtfully.  "I cannot guide you towards the questions you must ask so you must search for them yourself, and I need some time to discover their answers."You find yourself almost waking up as you fly in to dock.  You became so involved in the ebb and flow of the battle that you lost all sense of self and started to become one with the fabric of the universe.  The weaves being created by both sides had almost no meaning for you as you casually slipped between them all, somehow fading into the universe.Master Arando looks deep into your eyes as you exit your ship."I see that you are learning some of the answers I could not give you," he nods thoughtfully.  "This is what I had hoped."He shakes his head before quietly smiling, his face full of his solemn pride in you."Now that you have showed that you are willing to risk death for the Polaris people," he informs you with quiet happiness, "the Nil'kemorya have accepted you as being Ory'hara, and are willing to allow you access to all their technology and ships, even the Scarab.  Well done.  I look forward to meeting you again when the next opportunity to continue your training arrives."You see the solemn figure of Master Arando awaiting you as you exit your ship."For a moment, as I was observing the universe it almost felt like I was observing you," he informs you quietly, after you shake hands in the warrior fashion.  "The legend of Ory'hara says that you will become the spirit behind the creation of the universe.  After what I felt, I can no longer doubt you.  You will become Ory'hara."He shakes his head before quietly smiling, his face somehow full of sorrow.  Looking at him, you suddenly notice that his weaves no longer seem so opaque.  After a moment of wonder, you realize that you could defeat Master Arando if you chose."I wish you well," he continues gravely, "and I honor you not only for what you have done, but for what you will do.  I am no longer your master, as you have outstripped my ability to teach you.  I will continue to watch your life as it progresses.  I have no doubt that your deeds will resound throughout the galaxy."Drengar bows in awe of your abilities and the watching Aurorans all look momentarily stunned at the speed with which you dealt with your challengers.  Eventually one of the onlookers steps forward and addresses you in Auroran, which you do not understand."Don't worry," Mu'Sentan mutters as he brushes past you, "this is where I begin to make myself useful."He begins talking with the Auroran warrior who spoke to you, and as he does so you find yourself falling into an almost hypnotic trance as you observe the weaves around them and listen to their conversation.  Almost immediately you begin to pick up on the general meanings of the words being spoken.  You shake yourself out of it when Mu'Sentan turns back to you."They have offered to show me the exact location of the planet Rimerta on a map they have in the library," he tells you quietly.  "Meet me in the bar in an hour and I should be able to tell you where our next stop is."An elderly warrior steps forward, and you sense his keen intelligence through the tight control he maintains over the weaves around him.  He bows deeply in acknowledgment of your skill."We had heard that one whose strength was immeasurable had entered the Empire," he begins solemnly.  "Now we see that the stories of your skill were, if anything, understated rather than the reverse.  I am Du'Nakh, eldest living Dechtakar, and I am honored to have met you."I understand that you are here representing the Polaris?" he asks, looking inquiringly at you.  Both you and Drengar indicate Mu'Sentan with subtle weaves, and Du'Nakh turns his attention to the Mu'hari."We were told by a man named Eamon Flannigan that you might be the people to see regarding a few matters," shrugs Mu'Sentan quietly.  "Perhaps we could sit down and talk?""Archindar's honor is impeccable," nods Du'Nakh.  He waves Mu'Sentan over.  "Come, we will talk.""I guess we wait in the bar," comments Drengar wryly, and you laugh."After a moment of stunned silence someone calls for a bucket of water.  A young warrior runs forward and splashes the unconscious warrior who immediately awakens.  He slowly stands and turns to face you."I am Techerakh, Thurokiir of the Heraan House," he introduces himself, "and, until today I had not been beaten for over forty years.  You are truly a warrior among warriors."You nod, accepting his compliment before introducing yourself and your two companions, adding that Mu'Sentan has a number of questions that he wants to ask the elders of the Heraan House."Come this way," Techerakh tells Mu'Sentan quietly.  "I will present you to the Council of Elders myself."After the two of them disappear into the crowd, you sense Drengar walk over."You are more than a warrior among warriors, Ory'hara," he says reverently, "you are a master amongst masters.  Not even Arando could have defeated that man so easily."You shake your head and say that you are going to wait in the bar for the return of Mu'Sentan.You cannot help but sense the beginnings of the now familiar feelings of awe emanating from Mu'Randa and you smile a lonely, empty smile.  In that moment you realize that you have become a person apart, a figure of legend.  Never before have you felt so alone.You tell Mu'Randa that you need some time alone to clear your head, so that you can better appreciate everything that has happened to you in recent months."Of course," she agrees quietly.  "You have become so much larger than life, that sometimes even I forget that you are just a {G "man" "woman"} who has been give extraordinary abilities and been thrust into an extraordinary situation.  Take all the time you need.  If I have anything for you I will try to make contact with you wherever you are."You thank her and take your leave, wishing that, if only for a short while, your life could go back to the way it was before you became Ory'hara.#You sense that they are trying to twist the weaves of the device against itself somehow, without much success.  Acting on a whim you merge with the universe around you and casually divert its weaves towards yourself.Suddenly you feel pressed against the floor by the flows of the enslavement device, and only by continually manipulating the conditions around you are you capable of keeping at bay the terrible compulsion.  At the edge of your concentration you hear a gasp and you quickly emerge from your union with the universe and the pressure on your mind falls away as your weaves crumble.You look up to see all the Polaris looking at you in awe."...and he shall show us the way onwards," says Ver'Lahir as if quoting from somewhere and every person in the room bows in your direction.Embarrassed, you quickly tell them how you did it, and how they might emulate it using a series of simple weaves before telling Mu'Randa that you are tired from the long journey, and heading back to the privacy of your ship."You see," Mu'Randa explains jubilantly, "the Rebels were able to capture the leader of the Bureau, a woman who went by the name of 'Commander Krane', and now that we have Llyrell, we can free him, and therefore the rest of the Vell-os, which will mean that when this Krane woman is put on trial, she will be really put on trial before an unbiased Vell-os judge.  Imagine how damaging the verdict will be!"You cannot help but smile at Mu'Randa's enthusiasm knowing that your efforts will be instrumental in bringing to power a more reasonable Federation government.  You realize that the satisfaction you feel right now more than makes up for the loneliness of your existence."Anyway," Mu'Randa concludes happily, "we are over the moon with the way things have gone, and Bis Andreya has given me permission to open the Polaris treasury to pay you a sizeable donation for your efforts.  If you want, you can use it to buy our latest ship, the 'Raven', the most powerful vessel ever created.")As you stride over they catch sight of you and fall silent, watching you slightly suspiciously."Why have you disturbed us Ory'hara?" asks Techerakh from his seat at the foot of the table.  "I wouldn't think that you would barge in here so unceremoniously without reason."You nod and quickly outline the intelligence that Mu'Randa passed on, and her assessment that the Heraan House is a likely first target for the combined Moash and Bureau fleets.  When you finish, the Elders look at each other, doubtful of your story."I will vouch for Ory'hara," states Techerakh quietly.  "{G"He" "She"} is a warrior of the purest order, {G"his" "her"} words are as law."With that, the Elders look at you with renewed respect, and you realize that Techerakh's word obviously means a great deal to them."Thank you for giving us this information Ory'hara," Techerakh again pipes up.  "The Elders will now consider it and will prepare a plan of action.  I will meet you in the bar in two hours to let you know what has been decided."*Without pausing to think you hold the ten young warriors itching to attack you in place with weaves thick enough to support the mighty tower you have landed on, and you start up the stairs you know will lead you to the Dechtakar Elders.  Before long you are standing before a table headed by Du'Nakh whom you remember from when you visited here with Drengar and Mu'Sentan in tow."Ory'hara would not interrupt us so unless the matter were urgent," Du'Nakh says, mostly to soothe the rumbles of discontent at your sudden appearance.  "{G"His" "Her"} honor is impeccable, and we will hear what {G"he" "she"} has to say."You quickly recite the formula given to you by Techerakh, including the part about it being of interest to the Ruling Council, at which point everyone in the room starts to pay attention."If the Elders of the Heraan House want us to witness something of importance to the Ruling Council," Du'Nakh replies thoughtfully, "I would see it for myself.  Wait for me in the bar, I will meet you there in an hour.""Do not worry," he continues, holding up his hands to forestall the questions of the Heraan Elders, "the forms have been followed, and what I have seen has not been contaminated by either your views or those of Ory'hara.  You can be assured that my word will be as law before the Ruling Council, nobody can doubt its veracity."To keep it that way," he again forestalls any questions with an upraise hand, "I would ask that you say little now, so that no challenge of any sort can be made on the integrity of my word.  We have come for Techerakh, because he may be needed to take part in a meeting of the Council of Thurokiirs."You raise your eyebrows at the satisfied reaction of the Heraan Elders to Du'Nakh's last statement."If the First Family has so disgraced itself that it has been removed from power," Techerakh explains in a low voice, "the Council of Thurokiirs decides on who will be the next First Family.  Meet me in the bar in ten minutes, I will be ready to go then.""All the forms have been observed," Du'Nakh submits grimly.  "My word is uncontaminated, and I call to account the Moash House for treachery and deceit, and I call for the Council of Thurokiirs to be convened.""You can't do that, you need a full vote of the Council first," sneers one of the Moash representatives."I move that the Moash be struck from the position of First Family, and that the Council of Thurokiirs be convened," drawls one of the Tekel representatives, nodding in acknowledgment of Du'Nakh's suggestion.  "Votes against?"The hands of the Emperor and the three Moash representatives go up, their faces going white when they receive no support."For?" asks the same member and everybody else raises his or her hand.  "The motion is passed.  This Council is dissolved pending the decision of the Thurokiirs Council."As one, all the representatives, barring those from the Moash House, get up and leave."Meet me in the bar," whispers Du'Nakh, "and I'll explain what happens next.""Welcome back, Ory'hara," smiles a healthy looking Bis Andreya.  "We understand that you have an offer for us."You quickly summarize the events of your sojourn into Auroran space, ending with Du'Nakh's tentative offer to open diplomatic relations."You will be happy to know," Bis Andreya informs you after listening to your report, "that the Heraan House will be the new First Family after all the appropriate rites and ceremonies have been completed, and that we have received unofficial confirmation through Drengar and Mu'Sentan that they are still willing to begin talks with us."But for now we wanted to thank you for your actions in not only destroying the remnants of the despicable Bureau," she continues, "but also for being a part of bringing to power a more reasonable Auroran government.  You have our thanks and our admiration for your efforts, and we have placed a significant sum of money at your disposal, and it is our wish that you take the time to enjoy it."You sense Llyrell's growing wonder and Krypt's apprehension as you enter the cave.  Inside you see six bodies, perfectly preserved in cryogenic tubes."They must move on," you tell Krypt with quiet assurance.  "You must find your own way."Krypt nods and walks over to the cryogenic tubes, and in a sudden whirlwind of consciousness, transfers everything of the Krypt-tokh back into their bodies before dissipating completely."You did it!" exclaims Llyrell.  "And she destroyed herself to do it."You shake your head, telling him that she just gave back to them what they had given to her, but that she remains, although it will be centuries before she relearns how to project herself so intensely again.You give him a few instructions on how to operate the cryogenic machinery, before heading back to your ship.  With relief, for the first time in weeks, you dissolve your union with the universe, allowing your mind to return to its limited senses with relish.  While you were immersed in the universe you sensed Mu'Randa waiting for you on Mu'ar Haro, and whenever the Polaris ask for your help, you know it won't be long until you are once again immersing your consciousness in the universe..."As part of our agreements with them," Bis Andreya explains in a small voice, "we shared some of our technology with both of them.  We had hoped that it would be used to raise the standard of living in both realms, but it is going to be put to use on the battle-field first."We protested," she sighs sadly, "but they would not listen.  Both of them proclaimed that they could not trust the other, and that the weapons would only be used in defense of their own nation, but soon their technology will begin to outstrip their tactical ability, and it will be possible for one side to breach the defenses of the other easily and cause enormous amounts of damage.  We are within a few months of what could be the most terrible war in the history of mankind."You shake your head at the naivete of the Polaris before announcing that you will go to the bar for a quiet drink.  You tell them that in one hour you will tell them what you will do.Upon landing, it saddens you to see the once proud Polaris leaders file off, looking like broken men and women.  But they now know as well as you that the days of their civilization are numbered.  Soon their entire culture will have passed away under the weight of upcoming events."I will have a battle-plan for you soon," states Iuso, the only one still holding his head high.  Bis Andreya nods sadly, and Iuso bows before turning on his heel and heading towards his own ship."We will require a little time Ory'hara," says Mu'Randa quietly, seeing the distress on the face of Bis Andreya.  "But when we are ready, we will find you.  We will need your abilities to get us through this."You nod, wishing that there was something you could say to soften the blow to the very fabric of their lives.  Instead, you smile a sad, empty smile, and head back to your ship to feel again the thrills of being human, for you know that your own time also grows short.As soon as you land on the station the Nil'kemorya start laying waste to the infrastructure for the military in the sector.  Within minutes they are finished, and you have them announce on the Federation Holo-Net that you will next be coming to Earth, so that they have time to send their entire Navy to meet you.  In one fell swoop you will destroy their ability to make war...As soon as you land you are met by Tre'Nerida and after bowing respectfully you introduce him to Samantha, and he greets her politely before turning back to you."We will begin setting things up immediately Ory'hara," he informs you seriously in the Polaris tongue, "but before I go, I want to convey the thanks of the Tre'pira for your efforts.  If you ever need a little more money, feel free to head over to Tre'ar Zalom to offer your services to help carry freight between our two nations."I wish you luck on your journey."With that he turns back to Samantha and leads her away into the distance.Upon landing you are greeted by a small crowd of people, most of whom are wearing the green flowing robes that you have learned belong to the engineer/healer caste, called the Ver'ash, but there are a sprinkling of blue robes belonging to the scientists like P'Jeena and even one utilitarian black jumpsuit that belongs to a member of the Mu'hari."So how does it work?" asks one of the Ver'ash in an excited tone."The Wraith have learned to fold space around them so that they are physically impervious to harm," replies P'Jeena quietly."So it is as though they 'cloak' themselves in space/time?" asks one of the scientists.P'Jeena nods before turning to you."We have a fair amount of work ahead of us to take this knowledge out of the laboratory and into the real world," he tells you quietly.  "But if you could keep checking back here, we will probably have need of your services before too long."With that he disappears into the station talking rapidly to his colleagues.You take your time as you shut your ship's computers down, as you want the Ver'ash or the P'aedt waiting outside to know just how much they offended you.  As soon as you finish you step out of your beloved <PSN>, and indicate with a wave of your hand that they may begin."Thank you for doing this, Captain <PN>," says P'Jeena contritely, "and thank you for pointing out our poor manners and etiquette.  We are all truly sorry for the irritation we caused, and are grateful that you brought it to our attention, so that we might learn to conduct ourselves better."I have made sure that your account has been suitably recompensed," he continues quietly, "and I will make sure that we do not harm your ship in any way.  Even from our preliminary scans we have seen that the Zephyr ship itself is capable, even if the cloak could do with a little more work, so we have made it available to you.  Drop back here in three or so months, because once we have analyzed this data, we will be needing someone to gather more data for us.  In the mean time, keep an eye out in the mission BBS's, as I have heard that Mu'Randa might have something for you before too long."You take your time going through your post-flight routine, knowing that all the P'aedt and Ver'ash will be eagerly waiting outside your ship.  As soon as you finish you step out of your hatch and invite them to begin their work with a smile and a nod to acknowledge their new-found manners.P'Jeena comes over with an elderly gray-cloaked warrior in tow."This is Iuso," P'Jeena introduces the lean man with obvious respect, "he is the leader of the Nil'kemorya, and wants to have a word with you.""I have heard quite a lot about you," he begins smoothly.  "From what I've heard about you from Mu'Randa, Bis Andreya and P'Jeena here, you are a fairly resourceful {G "man" "woman"}, and you are the closest thing we have to an expert on the universe outside Polaris space.  There is a fairly important scouting mission going to occur soon, and I'm going to recommend that you be the one to take it."In the mean time," he adds significantly, "I've removed my objections to you having access to some of our more basic warrior technology."I want you to keep an eye out," he finishes quietly.  "I'll be keeping an eye out for you."As soon as you finish your post-flight routine, you decide that you had better head to the bar to find this off-duty dockmaster...You quickly go through your post-flight routine, knowing that all the P'aedt and Ver'ash will be eagerly waiting outside your ship.  As soon as you finish you step out of your hatch and they bow to acknowledge your efforts on their behalf.P'Jeena and Ver'Lliana come over as the many P'aedt and Ver'ash begin swarming all over your ship taking readings."Thank you once again," P'Jeena begins respectfully.  "This might have seemed trivial to you, but I assure you the ramifications of this technology are enormous.""Yes," agrees Ver'Lliana smiling.  "But it won't stop there.  I already have a few ideas of how to use this technology in other ways.  Keep an eye out around here.  We may need you again."nAs soon as you land the warriors start almost delicately destroying the infrastructure used by the Federation Navy.  Within hours, while the Kane Band has retained its ability to build basic ships, all of the components used to build weapons and military grade outfits have been destroyed.You realize that your almost cataclysmic campaign against the Federation is now over.For the first time since you began this war you concentrate your perceptions towards the Auroran operation, to find it faltering at the last hurdle.  You quickly pass on to the remainder of your fleet your intention to meet up with the Auroran half of the Polaris operation in the Aurora system, and help them destroy the ships there.  Those warriors that remain capable of joining you, do so, in the final act they will take as members of the Polaris government.As your mind sinks deeper into union with the universe, you struggle to maintain your defense of the Polaris ships.  More than once, only Mu'Randa's mental cries are all that keep you from forever losing your sense of self.However, you finally reach Aurora, and they receive the same treatment the Federation got, leaving behind almost no central infrastructure.  You know that you only have one last stop left.Satisfied, you power up your ship after painfully withdrawing one last time from the union.  You want to visit the memorial to the man who inspired all this.  Once more you go to Ar'Za Iusia, this time to leave behind your humanity.(With Ory'hara gone, the Polaris were quickly and kindly assimilated into the cultures of the Auroran Empire and the Federation.  Their act was never forgotten, and slightly less than two centuries later, humanity was once again united and the 'First Period of Disunity', which had started with the Polaris exploratory expedition and the Vell-os War, was finally bought to a close.  Only the 'Second Period of Disunity', which, due to the two century long Shard War, resulted in many more deaths despite being much shorter, marred humanity's development from ape to god.Oddly enough to all concerned, both periods were brought to a close through the actions of an individual named Ory'hara.  In both cases the person in question seemed to arrive out of nowhere, and once the job was done, they both disappeared again.  More than a few people believed that they were both manifestations of the spirit of the universe, but such talk was scoffed at by most people.Scoffed at that is, until the day, 50000 years later, when humanity finally joined their Vell-os cousins beyond the veil and learned the truth.  In a final act of thanks, they left the word Ory'hara attached to every construction they had ever made.When, after millions of years, other youthful races finally developed interstellar technologies and stumbled onto the moldering remains of the ancient human civilization on a thousand worlds, they could not help but wonder at the single word telepathically embedded in every stone.And so the legend of Ory'hara lived on...|As soon as you land on the station the Nil'kemorya quicly put down the Auroran resistance.  Within minutes they are finished, and you have them announce on the Auroran Holo-Net that you will next be coming to Aurora, so that they have time to send their entire Navy to meet you.  In one fell swoop you will destroy their ability to make war...As soon as you land the warriors start almost delicately destroying the infrastructure used by the warriors loyal to the central Auroran seat.  Within hours, while the Aurorans have retained their ability to build basic ships, all of the facilities used to build weapons and military grade outfits have been destroyed.You realize that your almost cataclysmic campaign against the Aurorans is now over.For the first time since you began this war you concentrate your perceptions towards the Federation operation, to find it faltering at the last hurdle.  You quickly pass on to the remainder of your fleet your intention to meet up with the Federation half of the Polaris operation in the Sol system, and help them destroy the ships there.  Those warriors that remain capable of joining you, do so, in the final act they will take as members of the Polaris government.As your mind sinks deeper into union with the universe, you struggle to maintain your defense of the Polaris ships.  More than once, only Mu'Randa's mental cries are all that keep you from forever losing your sense of self.However, you finally reach Earth, and they receive the same treatment the Aurorans got, leaving behind almost no central infrastructure left.  You know that you only have one last stop left.Satisfied, you power up your ship after painfully withdrawing one last time from the union.  You want to visit the memorial to the man who inspired all this.  Once more you go to Ar'Za Iusia, this time to leave behind your humanity."So what did you learn?" asks P'Jeena when you exit your craft and you reply that you learned that you are not yet ready to deal with Krypt."Is it that powerful?" he asks, going pale, and you nod grimly.You quickly detail the events of your journey, and pass on all the impressions you got from observing the mind of Krypt throughout.  You finish by describing the events of the attack upon your mind, and by informing P'Jeena that you need some more time before you will feel ready to face her again."I understand," he bows, acknowledging the skill required to have even survived.  "I apologize for exposing you to such a powerful and uncaring being.  We will analyze what information we can garner from your sensors, I can only express my deepest thanks for the efforts you went to in securing it."Please Ory'hara," he concludes seriously, "do not return until you feel you are ready."You find P'Jeena and a small group of his colleagues waiting for you when you step off your ship.  You are introduced and you exchange greetings with them all."So what did Llyrell say?" asks P'Jeena, clearly excited in his bookish way.  "Could he shed any light on the subject of the Krypt Pods?"You reply that he may have.  To allay their confusion you go into more detail regarding your conversation with the Vell-os, telling them of the Krypt-tokh and how they disappeared just before the end of the Vell-os War, and of how the Krypt attacks and overwhelms every Vell-os who attempts contact."This is very interesting," comments P'Jeena when you finish.  "We will need some time to run an analysis of some of the most likely scenarios, but I doubt we have enough information to reach any kind of conclusion.  Keep an eye out in the bar here - I don't doubt that we will be needing your services again, Ory'hara."."It is good to learn that the Polaris still remember the legend we gave them all those centuries ago," he smiles knowingly at your confusion.  "As you already know, Ory'hara is a Polaris adaptation of a Vell-os concept.  To us the word translates roughly as 'the guardian spirit that lies beneath the currents of life', but of course it is very difficult to put words to our telepathic thoughts with any accuracy.  To the Polaris you are going to become some mythical figure who will reunite humanity.  We know that both are true, but we are unsure of exactly how."You open your mouth to tell him of your purpose but he holds up a hand stopping you in your tracks."I know why you're here," he tells you quietly.  "Meet me in the bar in two hours and we shall talk further."CAs a group of dockworkers unloads the shipment of <CT> from your cargo bay you are a little surprised to see the traditional long hair and utilitarian jumpsuit of a Vell-os coming towards you.  The nameless Vell-os looks at you oddly for a moment before smiling softly and walking away.LYou are not terribly surprised to see your Vell-os friend waiting for you when you land."I can see the devastation in your mind," he tells you sadly, and you are reminded that all Vell-os are powerful telepaths.  "We knew that the Colonial Council had destroyed it, but we had hoped that it might have recovered a little in the intervening years."I'm glad the Krypt-mind left you alone," he says with a mysterious smile.  "It always attacks every Vell-os that approaches it.  For some reason it leaves you humans alone."Anyway," he explains, after shaking himself out of his reverie, "it is imperative that you learn more about yourself.  You must go and see my friend Fllyraen who lives on New England in the Wolf 359 system.  He isn't always around, but if you keep stopping by occasionally you'll catch him eventually."After he walks off, you are left with more questions than answers.  What is this Krypt-mind?  What is it you need to learn about yourself?  What exactly is going on?  You resolve to find this Fllyraen and ask him as soon as possible.VYou feel a sudden pressure inside your head and your mind is forced open.  In one awful instant you can sense Llyrell's mighty awareness, and the dark bands of the constraint on his mind before realizing that you can feel the very same bands on your own mind.  In a sudden whirlwind of discovery you can feel the intelligences of the people throughout the spaceport and beyond, their emanations becoming less distinct the further away they are.  You can even sense some of the physical attributes of the surrounding space, even as far away as a couple of systems away.Looking back at Llyrell you can almost feel a network of gossamer thin filaments radiating out from him to thousands of other glowing, telepathically-aware intelligences spread throughout the galaxy.  In a sudden whiff of insight you realize that the Vell-os have achieved a form of hive mind, where they can share each other's experiences and memories.<good now you can see the universe of the mind use it wisely or you will spend all your life twisting the hate out of their minds>You spend a moment casting your awareness around the universe before Llyrell intrudes into your thoughts again.<the bureau wants you to keep checking in at the bar here as this is one of the places they hand out assignments like it or not for now you are their property>You are met by a slightly suspicious rebel dockmaster who inquires as to why you have landed here.  You explain that you feel obligated to do something for the Rebellion seeing as they are fighting the Bureau.  You tell him that what you have learned of the Bureau does not fit with your ideals for the Federation, and you are a {G "man" "woman"} of action and cannot just sit by and let them continue on their merry way.You can sense that the dockmaster remains suspicious but after a deft helping touch on the swirling of his mind, he decides against questioning you further."We always have a need for freighter captains," he explains, "and you can do that without actually gaining a lot of our secrets.  If you were planning on doing something more dangerous, you are going to have to prove yourself first."Go and see the dockmaster on Merrol in the Aldebaran system while he is off-duty in the bar and give him this," he hands you a small data crystal.  "He should be able to find something for you."You follow Jay into his spartanly furnished office and he sits you down on a comfortable chair."I take it," he states, "that you will be wanting to move your way up the ranks to the more exciting missions."When you nod he grins and claps you on the shoulder again."Good to hear," he says with an approving smile.  "Of course, we live in times when trust is at a minimum, and if you want to become involved in the more exciting missions, then you have to prove yourself worthy by doing plenty of the tedious, lower risk runs."To get you started," he goes on, "I'm going to make these food drops a regular occurrence, and each one you do will go a little way to proving yourself to the Rebel High Mucky-Mucks."You nod in understanding."In the meantime, here's 15000 credits to play with," he hands over a credit chip.  "Have a few drinks on me."With despair in your heart, you realize that you have taken the first step towards destroying these brave people.Once again you follow Jay into his spartanly furnished office."It looks to me," he states with a mischievous grin, "as though the people in charge of this are starting to look your way."He claps you on the shoulder again, and you observe the growing affection he is feeling towards you."Well, you're on the way," he says with an approving smile.  "Of course, it will take some time, and things won't happen overnight, but I think that you have begun your long journey to the top.  Keep putting in the hard yards and you should get there."To help you out," he goes on, "I'm going to clear you to receive these equipment drops from the Mission BBS so that you can clock up a few more brownie points."You nod, understanding that your willingness to do this sort of grunt work will go a long way towards impressing the people in charge of your loyalty."In the meantime, here's a whopping 25000 credits to play with," he hands over a credit chip.  "Have a few drinks on me."You reach out and touch Commander Krane's mind, manipulating it slightly so that she hears a voice telling her to meet you at the spaceport as you slide down through the atmosphere.  Not more than ten minutes later she walks out onto the concourse."Found something have we," she says smiling, but you can sense that your demonstration of your telepathic abilities has disturbed her.  "Well, don't just stand there, tell me."You hand over the photos and relate to her where they were taken before going on to confirm that the person in them is a Mu'hari."Good work," she compliments you.  "Don't stop looking though.  We still only have a fairly incomplete idea as to how their network is set up."As she walks away, you cannot help but cringe at the thought of getting complimented by such an evil person, and once again you are left completely deflated.It only takes you moments to locate the person you are searching for because the Mu'hari's mind has been brought up in a social environment vastly different to what is experienced within the Federation, and to a telepath it stands out like a beacon.With a heavy heart you head towards Bureau HQ to make your report.You are greeted upon arrival by the soldier who is your normal contact, and you quickly confirm to him the Bureau's suspicions."This is becoming intolerable," he comments quietly.  "We need a new plan of attack that can ferret out these Mu'hari faster than we have been doing so far.  Keep an eye out, chances are we'll be needing you again soon."Your passenger exits straight into the arms of the waiting Bureau 'investigators'.  He looks confused for a second before going red and turning on you, enraged.  He lunges only to be forcefully restrained by the pick up team."You're going to pay for this!" the rebel agent yells with impotent fury, as you watch on sadly, wishing you could will yourself to help him.One of the men restraining the rebel clubs him over the head with a short baton and he slumps unconscious."Good thinking," nods the leader and the man is dragged away.  She turns to you, "We will have a replacement for you to take back to the rebels in a few hours.  Meet us in the bar."When you get into his office he goes over and starts rummaging through his desk drawers."Here it is," he says at last pulling out a credit chip.  "This should keep you eating for a few more days."I'll see to it that the General Smarts of this universe hear about this," he promises more seriously as he hands you the chip, "it never hurts to get in a little good PR."As you leave his office, you cannot help but feel despair at the damage you have already done.Fiona looks a little confused when she sees the Bureau strongarms as she steps out of your hatch.  Comprehension comes slowly as she turns to you in despair.  You turn away, shamed beyond words, as she stumbles into the arms of the waiting Bureau team..."Thanks," says one of them casually as another smashes her over the head a few times with the short batons they all seem to carry."Commander Krane left a message that you are to make contact in the usual place," says the attractive team leader as her team drags away the unconscious rebel.  "We will take care of the rest of the operation to replace her with one of our own."You take a few moments to collect yourself from the horror your life has become as the team leader slowly walks away.VSurprisingly you see the blonde hair of Commander Krane waiting for you as you exit your ship."Things went well?" she asks by way of greeting and you nod, saying that it would probably be best if you and her could talk in private."{G"I didn't know you telepaths felt that way,\" she laughs, fluttering her eyelashes" "This had better be important,\" she mutters"}.  "Follow me."She takes you to the familiar empty-looking office."So tell me what you saw," she casually commands.  In response you quickly run over what you saw from beginning to end leaving nothing out.  As you finish she looks both impressed and satisfied."Good work!" she praises you sincerely.  "You are more observant than I gave you credit for.  We will have to make a couple of minor adjustments to our intel picture, but we should be able to keep to our timetable."I have to pass on your intel to the proper people," she tells seriously, "but I don't want you wandering to far.  Once I've gotten confirmation on a few things, I will need your services again.  Keep an eye out in the bar."mAs soon as you land you head off to find Krane's office."Things went well?" asks Krane politely when you enter.  You nod with a shrug.  "Well, your little diversion worked.  The Moash warriors were drawn to the site of your raid which allowed the amassed Federation fleet to launch an attack on the skeletal defenses which broke through their line almost immediately."You nod at her confirmation of your suspicions."By all accounts," she explains with a smile, "most of the Moash fleet has either been defeated or captured, and we are in possession of their homeworld.  More than that, we managed to grab the house elders before they managed to escape."Now that you're back," she informs you dismissively, "I'll be needing you for a diplomatic mission of sorts.  Keep an eye out in the bar, I'll have everything ready for you soon."Finally you explain that, in general, Bureau policy is deliberately designed to keep the status quo by keeping the masses happy and by keeping its own involvement completely secret.The elders confer amongst themselves for some time before your patience begins to run out.  You can sense that they are deliberately stalling to see if you will give them any more information that they might use to their advantage.  In disgust you stand up and inform them that they have two hours to reach a decision, and that you will await their response in the bar.You walk out with several Bureau negotiators in tow all trying to talk to you at once.  And since none of them seem to be giving you direct orders, you decide to get away from them the easiest way you know how.  With a moment of concentration, you simply wrap yourself in your Vell-os Dart and pretend for a short while that the outside world does not exist.You are slightly surprised to sense the deceitful weavings of Commander Krane's mind awaiting you as you pilot your way down through New England's atmosphere.  After dissolving your protective Dart-shaped shield you are greeted by the sight of her blonde hair and athletic figure."So what did they say?" she asks quietly as she takes your arm and draws you out of earshot of the dock workers busily moving around the area.  You give her a quick summary of the events of your trip and she looks pleased."Good work!" her cheeks dimpl{G"e attractively" "ing"} as she smiles at you.  "Our plans are proceeding nicely.  I have a few things I have to take care of, so I will probably be a little out of contact for a while, but it shouldn't be too long before I need your services again.  Keep an eye out in bars anywhere in the Federation.  When I need you again, I'll find you."You are met by the soldier who is normally your contact in the bar who draws you aside."Commander Krane is currently detained doing other things at the moment," he explains seriously, and you sense that he has no idea as to her current whereabouts.  "She wanted me to tell you that she will need your talents again in the near future when the plans you just delivered to the Moash start coming to fruition.  So keep an eye out in bars.  If we need your help again, that's where we will make contact."The soldier claps his hand on your shoulder, nods and walks away, quickly disappearing into the crowd.  You notice after the fact that he seems to have the ability to blend into the crowd and be completely inconspicuous, even though he wears the very distinctive uniform of a Federation naval officer.  You sense that he is simply doing something he was taught many years ago and has done many times since.Upon landing on <RST> you are again met by the soldier who is normally your contact in the bar.  He quickly draws you aside."A new situation has arisen," he explains urgently, "and Commander Krane is currently looking into it.  She wants you to keep an eye out in bars around the place, as that is where she will make contact with you when she needs you."The soldier {G"jovially claps his hand on your shoulder and shakes his finger at you with a smile before ruffling your hair and moving" "steps forward and gives you a warm hug before stepping away and smiling.  He moves"} away saying that he will see you later tonight.  Anyone watching would have thought the exchange was between two old friends meeting for the first time in a long while.  You smile at his disappearing back and shake your head in keeping with the charade, while letting your mind slip into thoughts of freedom.-You are greeted by the soldier who is your normal contact, and you quickly confirm to him the Bureau's suspicions.  You add that it is easy to spot the Mu'hari because their minds are so different to anybody from the Federation in the hope that he might still think it too risky to try capturing a Mu'hari at this time."Another piece of the puzzle," he comments quietly.  "The more we know about them the sooner we can come up with a workable plan.  Keep looking in the BBS', it won't be long until we need you again."You are met by a calm looking Commander Krane when you land, but you can sense that despite her unruffled exterior she is quite worried about the threat posed by these 'Mu'hari'."Did you find it?" she asks slightly impatiently as you make your way over.You nod and inform her of the co-ordinates of the Mu'hari system and the Mu'ar Haro planet."That's too far away," she mutters in an annoyed tone.  "We're going to have to deal with them from this end.  Damn!"You are slightly take aback at her display of emotion and say nothing as she thinks for a few moments."Alright, there's no use beating ourselves up about things we can't deal with," she sighs quietly.  "Keep an eye out in the bar, we're going to have to do this the hard way."<"This will complicate things a little," he grimaces, recovering quickly.  He stands there for a few moments, and you can sense him trying to make a decision, and your hopes rise.  You can sense him weighing up his options carefully.  After a few seconds, he straightens.  "I was going to bring you along with us to capture her, but if she is capable of giving you a hard time if you're just trying to probe, I think that it would be a little too risky.  For now I'm going to leave you to your own devices, but don't go to far and keep an eye out in the Mission BBS', as we will probably be requiring your services again before too long."As he walks away you cannot help but feel a moment of triumph knowing that you have spared the life of one brave young lady for at least a little while.You are met by the soldier who is your normal contact, and you quickly tell him that it was just a rebel informant."Oh well," he shrugs, smiling, "we can't expect every suspicious person to be a Mu'hari.  Still, it never hurts to know the whereabouts of a few more of those silly rebels."Keep looking in the Mission BBS' for more of these searches," he finishes dismissively.  "We are getting reports of suspicious activity all the time."(You can sense the plotting mind of Commander Krane waiting for you as you slide down through the atmosphere.  As soon as you dissolve your protective barrier she comes over."We are going to start going about looking for the Mu'hari a little more cleverly," she begins without preamble.  "Now you say that you can detect them easily?"You nod, realizing that the Bureau may have found a way to exploit your attempts to save the Mu'hari."Excellent," she says in a satisfied tone.  "Here's what I want you to do.  Simply put, look around, keep your telepathic senses open.  I want you to find these damn Mu'hari, and when you do, I want you to report back here.  Understand?"You nod, your heart sinking in your chest."Good," she replies quietly.  "Now get to work."@To your surprise you can sense Commander Krane already waiting for you as you gently slide down through the atmosphere."I take it you have another Mu'hari to report?" she asks grimly and you nod.  "Whereabouts?"You tell her the exact location and hand over the photos."Okay," she nods, barely even glancing at the photos, and you can tell even without touching her mind that things are about to start rolling.  "We've come up with a plan to deal with these Mu'hari, and we'll be needing your skills.  Meet me in the bar in one hour."You sense the awe-filled reactions of the waiting Aurorans as they watch you slide down to the landing pad.  As soon as you dissolve your protective shell an older warrior with hundreds of small tattoos covering his exposed areas of flesh makes his way over and introduces himself as the task force commander Ar'Krakh."You are here to guide us into battle against the mysterious Polaris, no?" he asks in a soft, almost sibilant voice, and you nod, sensing that he is one of the most physically capable men you have ever met.  "We will need a couple of hours to make our final arrangements.  Meet me in the bar in three hours and we will be ready."With that he turns on his heel and you watch him give a few quiet orders whereupon his men scurry into action.uYou begin dancing amongst the Polaris, using their own energy to build barriers around their telepathic senses to stop them from attacking.  Within moments the Polaris see the futility of their efforts and the attacks cease.In a flash of inspiration you realize that you can now see how your brain functions as separate from your mind.  With trembling fingers you reach back and remove the enslavement device, watching with interest the flares of activity in the parts of the brain that it controls, but keeping them from affecting you.  In moments you are finally free."How did you survive the destruction of your nanites?" asks one of the nearby Polaris after several awestruck moments, and with that comment you realize just how these evil devices retain control of even the most powerful Vell-os telepaths.  The devices destroy the nanites that are a biological necessity for every Vell-os.Then in a moment of surprise you can sense that Ar'Krakh managed to reach an escape pod and is being transported to the surface.  You reach out and manipulate his mind, telling him to meet you in the bar.You nod and send her a series of images letting her know that Llyrell is a T1.<then you will need a link you are a t0 even though you dont know it yet but if you are placed under enough duress you would learn what you have to do the only way the vell-os will link with you is if they are ordered to attack you by the leader of the bureau because no other source has enough authority for them to go against their standing orders to resist being freed>You nod thoughtfully before asking Krypt how to go about trying to provoke Krane into ordering the entire Vell-os race into attacking you.<go to goliath in the south manchester system and tell the vell-os there that you are going to new england to destroy the bureau utterly and if you succeed in getting there krane will order llyrell to try to destroy you but he will only have any chance of doing so if he uses the energy of all the vell-os into you then you can join them into one mind to free them then we can worry about moving on>Prime awakens.  Looks around.  Feels small twitches trying to gain control.  Irritated Prime removes the twitches.  Watches the metal irritations fall to the ground.  Senses female-human.  Name surfaces --krane--.

Prime enjoys feeling another irritation pass.Prime looks up into the higher realms and is greeted by obsidian mental-female --krypt--.<come join me prime together we will explore>Prime wonders and resolves to live again.  Soon.Prime closes eyes and falls asleep.***As suddenly as everything went black, you feel your consciousness return to its normal size.  Your mind is once again contained within your skull as opposed to some multi-dimensional space.  As everything returns to normal, you find yourself standing across from Llyrell, who is holding his enslavement device in his hands and looking down at the headless corpse of Commander Krane.  Llyrell drops the evil device to the floor with a look of wonder before looking up at you.<there is something i must do meet me in the bar in an hour>The rest of humanity always suspected that the Vell-os were behind the sudden release of formerly secret documents detailing the operations of the Bureau against people throughout the galaxy.  However, despite the era of peace and unification resulting from the discrediting of the Bureau and their allies the Moash House, the role of the Vell-os was never confirmed.Meanwhile Prime was waiting.And life went on and humanity continued to stumble forward.  Through wars, through peace, through a seemingly infinite number of crises and all their solutions humanity somehow survived and grew stronger.And still Prime waited.But eventually, after more than fifty millennia, humanity began to look to move beyond the physical universe and Prime was ecstatic.  With open arms Prime welcomed its younger brother to the higher realms.  Once they were together nothing could stop them.You are met by a man wearing the same blue-black uniform that Samantha had been wearing."My name is Sean Clarke," he introduces himself as he shakes your hand.  "Welcome to United Shipping.  I take it you have the package?"You nod and begin unloading your cargo with the aid of nearby dockworkers."Well done," he compliments you when you are finished.  "I'll take care of this one for you, but in future all deliveries are to be taken to the Deliveries Office and the staff there will notify the intended recipient of the arrival of their package."We have given you access to accept United Shipping missions through the Mission BBS," he informs you seriously.  "Obviously some missions will be more valuable than others, but I'm sure you'll notice that as time goes on.  We have now logged you in as an official UN Shipping Courier, and so if you are ever in need of assistance, you can call on the aid of any nearby UN Shipping ships, and they will offer their aid.  We make sure we look after our own, because precious few others are prepared to look after us.  Speaking of looking after our own, I have authorized a transfer of 10000 credits into your account.  In the future this will automatically be forwarded to you upon completion of a delivery."I wish you luck, Captain <PN>," he finishes, shaking your hand again.  "I'm sure we will see each other again in the future."As soon as you land you head down to the Deliveries Office and they quickly give you a hand unloading the package.  When you check your credit account you see that the payment of 10000 credits has been made.As soon as you land you head down to the Deliveries Office and they quickly give you a hand unloading the package.

When you check your credit account you see that the payment of 100000 credits has been made.Upon arrival you are met by a group of Aurorans, a couple of whom are covered with {b206 "many battle tattoos" "savage tattoos"} and who eye everybody {b206 "but their fellow warriors" "around them"} with disdain."I've already transferred the money into your account," Samantha tells you as she leaves your ship, "but don't go too far away.  If I need your services again in the near future, and I may well need to, I'll look for you in the bar, but I'm not sure how long I'll be."As soon as you land you jump out and take your package to the office of the dockmaster.  Without a word the huge {b206 "warrior with many battle tattoos" "man with a myriad of small colorful tattoos"} all over his exposed flesh takes the package off your hands.  He nods and turns away to get back to his work.  You recognize a dismissal when you see one and head back to your ship to go and meet Samantha on Aurora.("Am I glad to be back in the Federation," she tells you, smiling sadly.  "No more hulking warriors treating me like a second citizen, and no more negotiations with people who really don't give a damn whether I actually exist or not{b206 ".\"You politely ignore her somewhat ignorant view of the universe, telling yourself that she knows no better having been brought up in the Federation."  "."}"Despite what happened I still want to thank you for your help," she says, turning to face you.  "You couldn't have known what was going on, there is no way that we can blame you.  It was just one of those things that occasionally happens in life.  Anyway, I have authorized the transfer of 20000 credits into your account as promised.  I'm sure I'll see you around <PN>."h"Am I glad to be back in the Federation," she tells you, quietly happy.

"."}"Thank you very much for your help," she says, turning to face you.  "Without you, this would have been a complete failure.  I have been authorized by the head office to offer you not only the 50000 credits promised, but also a 50000 credit bonus."Also," she tells you finally, "if you happen to end up down in the Auroran Empire again and need some cash, there will be United Shipping deliveries offered in their Mission BBS'.""This is it," Jennifer tells you.  "Every Auroran port has one of these rather disorganized warehouses, and here is where you make your deliveries."Don't talk to anyone between leaving your ship and here," she warns seriously, "if you talk to the wrong person you may end up being killed.  But if you only talk to the people here you can't go wrong."I'm afraid I can't stay long," she says finally with a wistful smile, "but I've already transferred the money into your account, and if you keep an eye out in the Mission BBS', you will occasionally see a few more missions like this one offered to you.  It's been good talking to someone from the Federation again.  With luck we'll meet again."You leave the ship and make your way to the merchants warehouse without speaking to a soul.  The staff there grudgingly lend you a hand to unload your produce and tell you that agreed upon 100000 credits has been transferred into your account.BYou head over to the Deliveries Office to inform them of your arrival.  The staff willingly give you a hand to unload your cargo from your holds without any questions asked.  The manager of the office thanks you and tells you that 200000 credits has been transferred into your account.You head straight over to the Deliveries Office to inform them of your arrival.  The staff willingly give you a hand to unload your cargo from your holds without any questions asked.  You are a little surprised when a rather nondescript man comes over and thanks you for your delivery and tells you that the agreed-upon 500000 credits has been transferred into your account.AYou are met by a tired but happy looking Samantha and several members of the Tre'pira when you land."It is good to see you again 'Ory'hara'," Samantha bows deeply, obviously having learned a great deal about the Polaris culture.  "We will take care of things from here."I would love to stay and chat," she says finally with a wistful smile as the workers start unloading your cargo, "but as with any new enterprise there is still an awful amount of work to be done.  However I have taken the liberty of transferring the money into your account, and if you keep an eye out in the Mission BBS', you will occasionally see a few more missions like this one offered to you.  It's been good talking to someone from the Federation again.  I look forward to seeing you in the not-too distant future."/As soon as you land Tre'pira wearing their traditional white utility suits quietly and efficiently unload the cargo from your ship.  In a matter of minutes they are finished and one of them wanders over to inform you that the money has been credited to your account.!You watch them greet the first human explorers, and you see the golden days of their involvement with the Colonial Council.  You see the events leading to the Vell-os leaving the Council and then opposing them by standing with the Polaris.  Finally you see the events of the Vell-os War and the madness of the Colonial Council in enslaving the entire Vell-os race.The final few moments are filled with observations of the universe during the awful days of isolation following the collapse of the Colonial Council and the rise of the Auroran Empire and the Federation.  Finally you see the creation of the Bureau and how its leaders quickly moved to take control of the Federation and are now looking to take control of the surrounding space as well.As suddenly as the mental visions began, they stop, leaving you blinking back in the real world.<now you know>Tears spark your eyes as you watch a somber Fllyraen walk away, and you know he is remembering the sights and sounds of the ancient Vell-os civilization.T"The third rule," explains Fllyraen soberly, "is that you must resist all attempts to free you from your bondage with all your strength and to the best of your ability."And the last rule," he concludes gravely, "is that you must report all unenslaved telepaths to the nearest Bureau agent as soon as possible."<that is why you were enslaved but you can thank llyrell that he said you could be captured otherwise they would have destroyed you without thought but you might be able to grow out of your bondage unlike us vell-os we need to attain a higher level than you to gain our freedom>With a nod of your head you indicate that you have understood all the standing orders that you must follow, and to let Fllyraen know that you have accepted what he has told you."Good," states the Bureau agent brusquely.  "Make sure you keep an eye out in both bars and mission BBS's around the place.  Now return to your business."As he walks out the door, you and Fllyraen stare at each other for a long moment before Fllyraen drops his eyes in sorrow and follows him out.BYou head over to the Deliveries Office to inform them of your arrival.  The staff willingly give you a hand to unload your cargo from your holds without any questions asked.  The manager of the office thanks you and tells you that 150000 credits has been transferred into your account.Frandall meets you and Tomak at the hatch, and other rebel operatives begin to examine the extent of the damage to your beloved <PSN>.  Frandall looks vaguely worried about the fact that the entire Federation population seemed to know about the shipment.  He tells you that he is going to discuss the matter with the Rebel High Command."I have a suspicion that we are going to get you to do something a little different for us next time we send you out."He shakes your hand, and walks away, calling out orders to his staff.  Tomak thanks you quickly, before being whisked away by rebel staff for debriefing.^With the data from your sensors as backup, you are able to convey to the Rebels the power of the new weapon in their arsenal.  Frandall is especially happy at the result, and glad at the havoc you were able to wreak on the way back to Rebel II.As you leave your debriefing, Frandall walks up beside you.  "<PN>, you might like to hear this," he says, taking you aside.  "I didn't want to say too much just then, but the leak that caused all the trouble was located.  Lets just say that there won't be any problem from that particular double agent again."You remember a time when war was something you didn't have to think about, but now you realize that you are glad that Frandall is capable of being as ruthless as he is.  His ruthlessness means that agents and operatives like yourself have the best chance of survival.Olaf is furious with you."I don't care just how great the engine work is," he storms "Word has spread about what you did out there, and memberships are dropping faster than the temperature on Vrenna.  At this rate, we'll be running at a loss for decades."Olaf punctuates his final point by crashing his fist down on the table, and storms away.  You have a feeling you have made a big mistake.Olaf roars with laughter as you tell him all about the fun you had while getting the upgrades.  When you tell him about how the ship handles in combat, he gets very serious."I'll have to get the techs to look at what he has done.  If it's half as good as you say it is, I'd say that Skinny is a genius with mechanics."  You tell him that you readily agree, and you both head off for a drink, your laughter booming down the corridor.Later in the Bar, Olaf explains that the Alloy will enable his scientist friend to build small droids.  These droids will perform repairs to your ship while you are in flight, even during battle.  They will repair armor and generators and such while the ship is under fire.  The real trick is that once he has created the initial units, they will also replicate themselves, creating an almost unending supply of repair droids, without any sense of fear.  They will simply do their job every time, without any complications.  It sounds good in principal, but you must admit to yourself, you will reserve your judgement until the finished product is delivered.Olaf keeps quiet as you tell him about the scene at "Ryan's Last Chance".Olaf grimaces, " I remember one time, we had a hull decompression in battle.  Was serving on a cruiser at the time, and we lost half the crew in a heartbeat.  Some of the crew refused to remove their e-suits, even once we reached port.  They never served on a ship again."You nod, and together you both raise a glass to the souls of the departed.The 'Dampener' and repair droids have performed better than expected, and now that Dr. Ralph's family are free of the Federation, he is now free to join the rebellion.  He and his family tell you once more how much they appreciate your assistance, and they board a rebel destroyer to take them out of harms way.  You have become close in the past few weeks.  You'll miss them.You quickly decide that there is a line you won't cross and you draw out your blaster and shoot dead the surprised four man c-int team.The councillor gets up and dusts himself off before coming over to shake your hand."Thank you," he says sincerely, "I owe you my life.  These men would have destroyed my mind for some pathetic spy-game benefit.  They'll be after you too now.  I suggest that you get the hell out of the Federation as soon as possible.  My only suggestion would be for you to go to Rebel planet of Merrol in the Aldebaran system and ask for Jay in the bar.  He might be able to make you disappear into the everyday life of a freighter captain."You never know," he grins, "from there you could go on to become a high-ranking member of the Rebellion.  I am going to head out of Federation space myself.  Today has shown me that I cannot survive for much longer if I stay here."Whatever you decide to do, Captain," he claps you on the shoulder manfully, "I wish you luck."As soon as you say no you watch Samantha's face drop."It's not your fault," she explains after a moment, "you had no way of knowing, but the first part of the trial was a test of your willingness.  Now that you have said no, we are to leave the Empire."I will need to see a couple of people," she informs you tiredly.  "Meet me back here in a few hours."As you watch her walk out of the bar you don't think you have ever seen someone look so despondent before.With a sinking feeling in your stomach you carefully pilot your beloved <PSN> into the Polaris dock.  You know that you were detected by the Federation before you left their space, and the grave expression that has remained on Mu'Randa's face since bodes ill for your mission."Meet me in the bar in about an hour," she tells you quietly, "and I will inform you of the Council's decision, although I doubt that they will look favorably upon it as the Federation will have been alerted to our involvement."As she walks away you cannot help but feel that your failure to escape detection has made the ultimate success of the Rebellion that much more difficult.As soon as you land a dozen or so engineers begin swarming all over your craft demanding all your logs and taking all kinds of readings.  Shaking your head you comply with all their demands without comment until you see Sharon making her way over."You did well," she compliments you, " but then that's why we chose you for this mission.  Keep an eye out, we will have more of these missions for you in the future."HAs soon as you land Gli-tech dockworkers swarm over your vessel and in only a few minutes they have unloaded their cargo.Once again Sharon walks out and greets you."The money should be getting transferred into your account as we speak," she tells you in her feminine voice.  "Good work."As soon as you land Gli-tech dockworkers swarm over your vessel and in only a few minutes they have unloaded their cargo.Sharon walks out onto the concourse and makes her way over."Good work," she congratulates you.  "I've just notified the finance department to transfer 20000 credits into your account for your services.  If you want any more work like this, just look in the Mission BBS down the hall, and if I need you again I'll keep an eye out in the outfitters."As soon as you land, David and his team of scientists quickly set about unloading their cargo as speedily as possible.  You lend a hand and in just over two hours the job is done."Thank you, Captain <PN>," says David seriously as he shakes your hand.  "I've already authorized the credit transfer to your account, and if you want more work, just drop by the bar.  If I need anything, I'll contact you there."With that he and his team head off to begin setting up their camp.wUpon arrival you are greeted by David and his team and they quickly unload your cargo and begin opening it to inspect the contents for damage.  As they pull out device after bewildering device you can't help but shake your head at some of the bizarre looking equipment you have been carrying.  After nearly twenty minutes they seem satisfied and begin repacking the equipment back into the crates."Everything seems to have survived the trip in one piece," David grins, "and I can tell you that the credit transfer has already been taken care of.  Thanks again and keep an eye out in the bar."As soon as you land you suit up and help the terraformers to unload their equipment.  You can already see the results of their work in the growths of a bluey-green algae that have appeared in occasional patches on the ground.As soon as you are finished unloading David makes his way over and touches his helmet to yours so that the two of you can talk privately."Thanks again, Captain <PN>," he says sincerely as his team begins unravelling some type of thick plastic sheeting which you guess will end up being their home for the next few years.  "I have already notified Nirvana's head offices that we have arrived and they will have transferred 25000 credits into your account as usual.  If I need anything, I'll get the head office to place it in the Federation Mission BBS' system, so keep an eye out."With that he breaks contact and heads back over to where his team is working.You can see the changes wrought by the terraformers as soon as you land.  Much of the landscape is now covered by the blue-green algae that had barely gained a foothold when you were last here, and the thick smog-like atmosphere seems to be significantly clearer to you.You soon see a group of eight people in suits trekking towards you and when they get closer you recognize several of the members of the team and they smile in greeting.  You give them a hand, and in no time you have unloaded everything."Thanks again, Captain <PN>," says David after he comes over and touches helmets.  "As you can see we have made some progress, but we needed this to take the next step.  I've already passed on a message letting the head office know that you have arrived, and the credits should be being transferred into your account as we speak.  Keep looking in the Mission BBS', as we may need you again at some stage."You are amazed at some of the changes wrought by David and his team as you pilot your way down through the atmosphere.  From what you can see there is not only the blue-green algae, but also a significant amount of running water and even small amounts of plant life starting to spread around the equator.Once again David and some of his team come out to unload the equipment from your holds.  When you are finished you head over to David to tell him how impressed you are."Why thank you, <PN>," he answers, pleased at your comment.  "It is good to hear an outside opinion because it can be hard to notice the effects when you live here day after day after day."Anyway, we need to get back to keep an eye on a couple of things we just started growing," he explains seriously.  "The head office knows that you've arrived, so the 25000 credits should already be in your account.  Keep checking out the Mission BBS' as I don't doubt that we'll need your services again."Piloting down through the atmosphere you can see that the planet's surface is nearly half covered by water, and that the predominant life forms are now vegetation which covers most of the rest of the surface and that the oceans are filled with a simple plankton-like organism.  Your sensors show that there is no longer any need for the heavy environment suit, but that a breathing mask is still necessary.Once again after he and his team have finished unloading David comes over and shakes your hand."It might interest you to know that if we keep up the accelerated plant and algae growth, we may have a breathable atmosphere in around five more years," he tells you proudly, and you're impressed.  "It won't be long until we begin introducing animal life to start balancing the ecosystem a little more.  Keep looking in the Mission BBS', as we'll probably need you a few more times before we finish here."You are very surprised at the changes in the world you see below you as you fly down to the surface.  Your sensors tell you that the air is breathable, but that a breath mask is recommended for extended exposure of longer than 30 minutes.  But more than that there are literally thousands of animals running, flying and swimming all over the surface.As you unload you notice that a lot of your equipment looks like rudimentary weather control equipment and you ask David about it."Well we are getting to the stage that our ecosystem is starting to run itself," he explains, happy to share his knowledge, "but by our calculations, unless we manually interfere with the process this world will never be habitable for humans, so we are going to set up atmosphere 'purifiers' to see how effective they are in the hope that they can help us overcome it."You clap him on the back and tell him that he and his team have done an outstanding job so far, and that you have every confidence they will solve the problem.EAs you pilot your way down, you see a paradise of a world, with vast sweeping oceans, archipelagos, mountain ranges and vast forests.  According to your sensors the atmosphere is capable of indefinitely supporting humans, but is a little on the thin side.For the first time you see David and his team without any breathmasks or other apparatus come over to begin the unloading."The experiment with the atmosphere purifiers worked even better than we expected it to," David explains as you unload what appear to industrial fabrication machinery.  "So now we are going to start manufacturing the necessary equipment right here.  Within a few months this planet will be ready to be colonized.  Keep an eye out, I'll make sure you get one of the first loads so that you can see the finished product.""Oh, well," he tells you sadly, "we must now move on.  Now that we have proved that our theories can be successfully applied, Nirvana wants us to head out and do it all again.  It would be nice to settle down, but business goes on, and we have another fifteen years on our contracts."Still," he brightens considerably, "we get the legal ownership of a large piece of land on any world we terraform, and when my contract is up, I will be living in one of the most beautiful worlds in the galaxy."And one final thing," he finishes quietly, "Nirvana has been impressed by your reliability and will be making available missions transporting colonists here from all over the Federation through the Mission BBS'.  As for me, after my debrief I will be given another team and sent out again.  It has been nice knowing you <PN>.  Maybe I'll see you again in fifteen years time.  I wish you well..."As soon as you land near the main complex the colonists exit to begin the registration process of starting on a new world.  You wish them all the best of luck and shake the hand of every one.  You cannot help but admire their pioneering spirit.You are met by a beaming Sharon Masterton when you land."I'm impressed," she congratulates you warmly.  "As far as I'm aware you are the first person who has been able to make it through the Polaris defense grid alive.  Is there something you're not telling us?"She laughs and you grin."So where are the photographs?" she asks, becoming more serious, and you head back on board and fish them out and hand them over.  She takes a few moments to scan them.  "This is exactly what we were after.  It is worth every cent we are paying you."I need to get this to the appropriate people," she tells you, all business again, "but keep an eye out in the ship outfitting area if you want to be the one to test this new weapon when we eventually manufacture it."(As soon as you land a dozen or so engineers begin swarming all over your craft demanding all your logs and taking all kinds of readings.  Shaking your head you comply with all their demands without comment until you see Sharon making her way over."As always, you did well," she compliments you with a warm smile.  "You have the warm thanks of GLi-tech for all your efforts in testing and helping us to gain the technologies for our weapons.  Keep an eye out, maybe I'll have something more for you in the future.""Firstly," Rodney ticks off a finger, "you have been paid 20000 credits for your services and I have also made available similar missions through the Mission BBS' throughout the Federation."Secondly, as an employee of Sigma Shipyards you are allowed to purchase all the ships in our range," he informs you to your delight.  "In particular I am talking about the Starliner, the Pegasus, and the Leviathan.  If you can scrape together the funds, you can purchase them from here at any time.  You should also be able to find a few ship upgrade outfits available here on the Kane Band."Anyway, if you'll forgive me," he finishes a little tiredly, "I have a thousand and one things I still have to do today, so I'll take my leave of you.  Thanks again."As you pilot your way into one of the countless docking bays in the Sigma Shipyards area of the Kane Band you once again take a moment to glance over the enormous shipyards at their disposal.As soon as you land dockworkers swarm all over your vessel and in no time they have unloaded your cargo.  Their supervisor informs you when his people are finished that 20000 credits has been transferred into your account before moving on to the next ship.hAs soon as you land you sigh with relief.  The last few weeks have been pretty stressful, and you are glad to have made it back in one piece with your cargo intact."Well done," congratulates Rodney, when he drops by as you are unloading.  "This load should keep us going for another couple of months."You tell him the news from the small mining operation down there, and how they can hold out."Well that is good news," he mutters thoughtfully.  "So the only problem we have is shipping through the blockade.  I think we can do something about that."In the mean time," he concludes quietly, "keep an eye out around here, as I may have another mission for you in a month or two.  Why don't you recuperate for a little while; if you check your account, I think you will find that you have a little bit more spending money now... "As soon as you land a group of soldiers surround your vessel and demand that you unload your cargo.  You do so, taking great care not to provoke them in any way.  When you bring out the message pod, they quickly whisk it away."You have our thanks," states the detachment commander, "and please do not be offended by the way we have conducted our business with you.  By way of apology, we have transferred a fair sum of credits into your account, however I'm sure you can appreciate our need for security."With that he gives a signal to the troops around him and they quickly withdraw, leaving you standing there wondering what just happened.As soon as you land the staff of the Deliveries Office slide into action.  Within moments they have the machinery ready to begin unloading, and, like a well-oiled machine the process begins.  Just short of three hours later the manager of the Deliveries Office informs you that the unloading has been completed and that your money has been transferred into your account.fIt takes you the better part of twenty minutes to track down the dockmaster, and he takes about a half-hour to gather his people.  Then after a few more minutes of grumbling, work actually begins.  Typically, the Aurorans take their time and seem to delight in causing incidents in slowing down the process.  In the end a warrior is called over and the workers spring to action as if stung.  Still, from start to finish takes them slightly more than five hours, at which time the dockworker informs you in a gruff voice that your payment has been transferred into your account.As soon as you land the staff of the Deliveries Office slide into action.  Within moments they have the machinery ready to begin unloading, and, like a well-oiled machine the process begins.  The Federation dockworkers toil through the day and well into the night getting the job done as quickly as possible.  Just short of sixteen hours after you land the manager of the Deliveries Office informs you that the unloading has been completed and that your money has been transferred into your account.XIt takes you the better part of twenty minutes to track down the dockmaster, and he takes about a half-hour to gather his people.  Then after a few more minutes of grumbling and stuffing around, work actually begins.  Typically, the Aurorans take their time and seem to delight in causing incidents in slowing down the process.  In the end a few warriors are called over and the workers spring into action as if stung.  Despite their 'renewed' energy, the efficiency and skill of the workers is poor compared to their Federation compatriots, and the process drags on through the first day, through the night and on into the next day.  From start to finish takes them slightly more than thirty-two hours, at which time the dockworker informs you in a gruff voice that your payment has been transferred into your account.Under the guidance of the officious, yet helpful staff from the Deliveries Office, your passengers quickly exit your ship and collect their gear.  After only slightly more than twenty minutes, when everything has been sorted out, the manager of the Deliveries Office comes over to inform you that the operation is complete and that your money has been transferred into your account.sAgain the service provided by the Auroran dock authorities is shown to be a poor second-best when compared to that provided by their Federation compatriots.  They tell you upon arrival that they will only take the passengers off your hands once they have all exited your ship and collected their baggage.  It takes you the better part of two hours to get everything done to their satisfaction, but eventually the dockmaster informs you that he is happy and that your money has been transferred into your account.  You nod, annoyed at his incompetence, but powerless to do anything about it."When you're ready to take the next step towards redemption," Hune smiles, "stop by the bar.  I'm sure Lo Wang will have something for you."The terrapin captain thanks you for the escort, and pays you the 40,000 credits as promised.Olaf greets you as you land.  "Good to see you my brave Bonnie, how was yer trip?"  You tell Olaf that your trip was fine, and that the dock-workers fast-tracked all of the data crystals through the off-loading process for you.Olaf doesn't look surprised.  "Most o' those fellas used to crew ships at one time or another.  Most of 'em were good crew as well.  The Bureau kicked a lot of arse after yer father's death, and a lot o' fellas that wouldn't be told what to do found 'emselves without a crewer's ticket.  Now most o' them fellas are uneducated, and only knew how to crew.  So when the stinkin' Bureau revoked their tickets, it was illegal to put them into any ship, from shuttle to Leviathan.  Most of 'em lost the only livelihood they had, so I pulled a lot of strings through some contacts and got 'em jobs on the docks.  The Bureau tried ta remove vital parts of my anatomy fer that li'l stunt, but the lads stood firm and showed how a Dock can close down pretty quick.  Soon enough the situation settled down.  Come to the bar and we'll spend some o' yer hard-earned."He throws his arm around your shoulders and you head off to 'Club Scrun' for a couple of cold ones._You return to <RST> without too many problems.  The occasional pirate skims past you, but as your beloved <PSN> is fairly new and has not been on the shipping lists of many ports, the pirates have little to no idea of what you may be carrying.  You have no doubt that as your ship becomes better known, you will have to consider escorts, or the purchase of needed upgrades.  But for the meantime you are more than happy to let them think you are too small to hassle.  Piracy was once the random attacking of many smaller ships by loosely organized fleets.  Now many of the larger groups had banded together, creating a highly organized criminal network.  The largest fleet is run by a pirate called McGowan.  He has been the scourge of the Galactic North for over twenty years, but his tentacles reach further than that.  It is rumored that he even had control of large sections of the Main shipyards on half a dozen major Federation worlds.  You hope that one day the Federation finally finds a method of capturing the man, but until then, most shipping lanes will be at his mercy.You ask one of the cargo handlers what is actually in the crates, but one of the Naval Officers steps forward and says, "Sorry, that information is 'classified', and only released on a 'need-to-know' basis.  Unfortunately, you don't need to know."  He spins on his heel and walks away.You feel like telling him that you do need to know, as you are about to spend hours and credits repairing a ship that was pounded half to puss in getting the goods here.  Before you can say this, however, a junior officer steps forward and hands you a chip for 50,000 credits.  Your protests stop in your throat, and you start planning the upgrades to your ship you can now make thanks to the Federation Navy.Dace's office is in a dingy back alley far from the Spaceport.  On entering you're surprised to see the obvious opulence of the furnishings.  Dace appears, smiling at you as she recognizes you."Ah, you must be <PN>."  She waves behind you, and you turn to see a large man step out of a hidden alcove.  He is huge, with bulging arms and long, black hair.  In his hands is a painful looking blaster pistol, so large that the recoil from it would tear your arms out of their sockets."This is Hargor Both Barrels, an old friend of mine.  Your father found him in a burnt out wreck of an Auroran Cruiser.  He was the ship's boy - the only survivor.  He swore an oath to serve your father as long as he lived.""Most of us call him Gor."  His handshake nearly crushes your hand, and Dace smiles knowingly.  In a back room, she hands you a credit stick."It's not much, but it's all we have lying around right at the minute," she notes quietly, and you raise your eyebrows.  The credit stick is worth 480,000, which is a fair chunk of cash in anyone's vernacular, and if this is 'lying around cash' you cannot wait to see what the serious money is like.  After a couple of moments you shake off your surprise you quickly pass on to her that the Association of Free Traders will be up and running and to expect membership fees."It will be an honor working with you," she concludes quietly.With that you head back, with a healthier bank balance, but with a feeling you are about to spend a lot of money.The Rebel High Command takes little time to ratify the use of the Association of Free Traders as the freight handlers of the Rebellion.  Once the point was made that the Association would be responsible for the backlash from any intercepted shipments, the Rebels were more than happy to sign on the dotted line.  The deal was struck quicker than you dared hope, and after the meeting, many of the rebels came forward to inform you that they worked for your father.  You feel honored that they hold you in such high esteem.Before you leave, the dockmaster tells you to go and talk to the dockmaster on Merrol in the Aldebaran system to get more detailed information on what missions will be made available to you.On the return trip, he tells you that the port engine is having difficulty, and sure enough, once you land, it becomes apparent that the fuel intake valves were leaking.  At this point it was only a hairpin leak, but if left too long the engine would have either seized or blown.  Neither option appealed to you."I reckon we should see if Olaf is in at the bar," murmurs Blind Charlie in his quiet voice.  "It will be good to catch up with him again... "
You meet Sven working in the back room of a dingy nightclub.  He shakes your hand warmly, and tells you that his father was a sensor-man for your Father.  You observe him security scanning all of the patrons as they enter.  The scanners strip those waiting in line, first of their clothes, then their skin, showing all biological enhancement.  You start to laugh at one man, who has had the "Mr. Wonderful" nether region enhancement, when you realize that it was YOU standing outside scant moments before.  You think of Sven inspecting you, and blush a deep scarlet.As if reading your thoughts Sven smiles apologetically.  "Sorry Cap'n, I only looked for a moment, I swear."  Something tells you he enjoyed that moment though."Interesting software, Mr. Fjordnham," you tell him coolly."Yes, Cap'n, it is.  I designed it myself.  It's called the Nightprobe.  Olaf funded me during its creation, and it is fast becoming the industry standard.  Of course, the Association makes a fair cut from the profits."You both leave, and head back to your ship, wondering how many "little projects" Olaf has set up.  If they are all this clever, you'll surely make enough money to buy your own Universe and leave all the troubles of the one you are in behind.It takes you less than an hour to locate Ferret, and it only takes him a quick phone call to get Dizzy to drop by, making your job very easy indeed.Dizzy and Ferret seem to get along famously... which makes you think that the return trip will be extremely trying.  With a deep sigh you decide to head back to Viking to see if you can find out what Olaf is up to.You meet with the Rebel High Command.  After the news that the latest shipment has been lost the Rebels grow very long in the face.  A plan is hatched after some long discussion.  Frandall suggests that the best way to flush out the enemy is to create a shipment that is too tempting a target to pass up.  The plan is made to create a bogus convoy, packed full of important supplies and carrying the rebel high command.  A series of communications is sent back and forth, and the fleet is assembled.  The convoy contains very few freighters, and many warships.  The rebels are happy for you to deal with the enemy.  The fleet sets out to head back to <DST>, with every intention of being attacked by the enemy.You are happy to make a safe planet-fall on <RST>.  Dizzy slumps in his chair, gladly letting the helm sit idle.  It has not been an easy trip for him.  Sven has spent far too long at his post, and his eyes are so bloodshot that you can barely see any whites in them."Stand down, gentlemen, and see to it that you both get plenty of rest."They both salute and leave the bridge.  You pick up the hailer and inform Mr. Ferret to begin off-loading the databanks.  You remind him of their importance and ask him to place the best fighters on the cargo duty that day.  He chuckles, and tells you to relax, as he has already hand-picked the cargo crews for today, making sure that there are some hulking, but fast-reflexed lads among them.  You break the connection and sit back.  All you have to do now is wait, and you inform the Rebels that you will keep checking by the bar to see if they have unravelled all the information in the databanks and to look for you there when they do.&The rebel fleet arrives to find your battered but victorious fleet.  The <PSN> will need some time in dry dock in order to repair the badly damaged sections, but all in all, the day has gone well for the Association of Free Traders.  The rebel fleet takes up an escort position, and you land on <RST> to celebrate and recuperate.Frandall signals you that the Rebellion would like to start using the Association in a more offensive role, to make hit and fade attacks on the Federation.  He says that the Association ships seem well suited for this role, and that they can be used to make the Federation pay for the crimes and corruptions they have committed against the small man.You tell him that you will have to ask the remainder of the members, but that you think they will be delighted to take on that role.  The thought of fighting the Federation in the open appeals to you.  It is with a song in your heart that you tell Dala to set course for the great beyond.  What was your father's is now yours.  For now you are happy to leave things the way they are, and leave the worries of the universe to others, for a while.  You wonder who will step forward to take the torch from you.With a smile you head out into the dark comfort of deep space.  It has been a good day...You return to <RST> without too many problems.  The occasional pirate skims past you, but despite your beloved <PSN> probably being on their list to watch closely you manage to keep them from finding out what's in your cargo holds.Piracy was once the random attacking of many smaller ships by loosely organized fleets.  Now with McGowan running things, it has gotten out of control.  You don't hold out much hope that one day the Federation will spend much effort trying to capture the man, especially with his links to the Bureau.  Unfortunately, until someone does something about him, most shipping lanes will be at his mercy.TAfter you finish your post-flight routine, and giving your crew shore-leave, you head out to see your Uncle."Everything go okay?" he asks a little nonchalantly, and you nod, shrugging.  "Ah, you make me proud young'un!"You grin, and the two of you head to the bar to have a few drinks."This is a problem that'll pop up every now and again," Olaf notes, after a couple of ales have gone down, "so I'll keep an eye out in the Scheall system and I'll let you know if anything needs your attention in the future by posting a note on the Mission BBS system."5After you finish your post-flight routine, and giving your crew shore-leave, you head out to see your Uncle."Not too much trouble?" he asks a little nonchalantly.  You shrug and smile as you tell him it was fun.  He laughs and the two of you head to the bar to catch up.VYou are met by your contact soldier as soon as you land.  You give him a terse report of the operation which he records to take back to his superiors."This is something that will crop up from time to time," he notes quietly, "so keep dropping by Earth and if we need you that's where I'll make contact."yAs soon as you land you decide to head over to the bar to see if you can find Krane.You can sense the Vell-os waiting for you in the bar, and you decide to make your way their to confront her face-to face.As soon as you finish your post-flight routine, you decide to head to the bar to see if you can find Kuron.As you quickly go through your post-flight routine you decide to get Sven settled as soon as possible before heading to the bar to find Olaf.Right from the start of the trip Dizzy and Ferret made work impossible as they carry on like two old friends, until you asked Ferret how was he supposed to control a crew if he couldn't control himself?Abruptly the trouble stopped.  You allowed Mr. McHugh to take the Helm, and became slightly jealous when he made your own ship fly better than you could.  As time goes by you become used to buzzing through spaces that most pilots would have left well alone.Ferret kept the crew so well in line that you only noticed them when you told them about a job well done.  By the end of the trip, you are surprised to find that you are enjoying their company quite a lot.One thing that has been troubling you is the fact that one of your biggest trade routes has fallen prey to raiders far too many times.  There has been talk of a large pirate group specifically targeting Association convoys, and mostly when they are carrying Rebel supplies.  The rebels have been getting more than a little worried.  You will have to sort it out, and quickly.  As you land you see some sort of strife at the shipyards.  The blast-shields have been closed and there are warning lights flashing all over the base.  You decide to head to the shipyard as soon as you land.As soon as you finish your post-flight routine you decide to head to the bar to see if anyone is waiting for you there.As soon as you land a squad of four marines grabs you and drags you into the station operations center to meet Rear Admiral Vessair."So this is Krane's new toy," he comments to nobody in particular.  "Search {G"his" "her"} holds and bring the message pod to me!"Moments later the message pod is brought in by a soldier and Admiral Vessair casually punches in a code and opens it.  He quickly reads the contents before returning his gaze to you."Why is {G"he" "she"} still here?" He asks of the soldiers standing behind you."Sorry sir," replies the squad leader and you are bustled back to your ship almost faster than you arrived.  Nothing in your life has ever made you feel so useless and helpless.
This time as soon as you land a squad of four marines boards your ship, grabs you and drags you out into the spaceport and hold you down while they search your ship.  Tears of misery and degradation start to mist your eyes, but with all the conditioning you've had you cannot even bring yourself to protest.With impersonal force the soldiers holding you down drag you back onboard your ship and leave, shutting the door behind you.  In the sudden silence you are left with your pain.With shaking hands you complete your post-flight routine before heading off your ship.  Remembering Krane's instructions you head towards the ship outfitting area to see if you can find a Wraith Cannon and its ammunition.You are dragged out of your ship by a team of soldiers into the spaceport to where Commander Krane is waiting."Find the pictures," she snaps and several other soldiers immediately head into your ship returning moments later with the pictures you took of the Wraith cannon and the Wraithii."It seems I may have underestimated your capabilities," she murmurs quietly.  "Meet me here sometime in the next few weeks, and then we will see what is to be done with you."RAs soon as you land a dozen or so engineers begin swarming all over your craft demanding all your logs and taking all kinds of readings.  Shaking your head you comply with all their demands without comment until you see both Sharon and Krane making their way over."You did well," Sharon compliments you, "I was mildly surprised you defeated the two of them.""{G"He" "She"} is one of our best operatives," agrees Krane with a smile.  "Whenever something looks difficult and we want it done quietly, this is our {G"man" "girl"}.""I can see why," murmurs Sharon with a thoughtful nod.  "Anyway, the preliminary data still shows that the RAGE is a very competent ship in her class and we have started production anyway, so it will be made available to you at shipyards with the necessary facilities to make it."You follow Jay into his spartanly furnished office and he sits you down on a comfortable chair."I take it," he states, "that you will be wanting to move your way up to the ranks to get the more exciting, and more importantly, better paying missions?"When you nod he grins and claps you on the shoulder again."Typical 'merchant'," he says with a cheeky grin.  "Of course, we live in times when trust is at a minimum, and if you want to become involved in the more exciting missions, then you have to prove yourself worthy by doing plenty of the tedious, lower risk runs."To get you started," he goes on, "I'm going to make these food drops a regular occurrence, and each one you do will go a little way to proving yourself to the Rebel High Muck-Mucks."You nod in understanding."In the meantime, here's 15000 credits to play with," he hands over a credit chip, "have a few drinks on me."gYou walk in to see a vaguely familiar figure with short hair and a military bearing."Allow me to introduce myself," the man says easily, reaching forward to shake your hand.  "My name is Cade Smart, retired General."You realize that you are talking to one of the founding members of the Rebellion.  You remember vaguely that General Cade 'Sundown' Smart, as he was called, took command of the Federation's forces when the Aurorans had wiped out whole fleets of the Federation Navy under the incompetent command of his predecessor.  His brilliance kept the Federation alive at a time when its destruction looked a virtual certainty."I want you to know that we have been following your career carefully," General Smart continues, "and I wanted to pass on my appreciation for what you are doing.  We are truly grateful for your efforts."Jay tells me that he is going to make similar missions available to you through the mission BBS, and I can think of no-one better for the job.  We are looking forward to future involvements with you and your organization.  Thank you, Captain <PN>."After completing your post-flight routine you head out to see if you can find a few answers.  You are met by the same warrior who talked with you before the battle."Do you realize," he asks rhetorically, "that you are the first outsider in around six centuries who has helped us defend our borders?  Maybe what they are beginning to say about you is true."Regardless," he continues, speaking more directly, "the Polaris give generously to those who help them.  Your account has had a total of 100,000 credits transferred into it in payment for your courageous service."With that he bows and begins to move away, but turns back after taking a few steps."I am honored to have met you," he says, almost nervously.  "If you do become the one spoken of in the legends, I will be a glad man, for you have a good heart."As he walks away, you find yourself left with more unanswered questions than ever.$As soon as you land your ship is surrounded by groups of Nil'kemorya warriors who are all awestruck at the damage to the various parts of your ship."You really are Ory'hara," says one old warrior, as he looks over your ship.  "Who else could survive that with {G "his" "her"} level of training.  Perhaps Master Arando should hear of this."He turns to you and looks you up and down."Not only do you have a good heart," he comments quietly, "but you have good skill, and more than a touch of luck about you.  It appears that you are capable of putting the rudimentary weave-skills you have to good use."Now, while your mission was technically a failure," he smiles gently, "a donation of 100,000 credits has been transferred into your account for your efforts on behalf of the Polaris.  Very few people have the heart to do what you did, and even fewer have survived to return to us, so you will find that we will do what we can to look after you."Hopefully," he grimaces, "the money should cover the expenses to nurse your poor ship back to health.  How she survived that beating, I have no idea."One final note," he finishes seriously, "apparently Mu'Randa wants you to continue keeping an eye on the mission BBS's around the place, in case she needs to contact you."You play back the recording of the traitor's destruction for the mid-level Bureau official who meets you in the docking bay."Good work," he says, handing you a datapad showing your newly-clean Federation record on it.  "That should cover any damage done to your record.  We will contact you again when we require your services."You {b5762 "sigh and wonder if you will ever be free from this endless series of dirty jobs, and whether you will ever be able to atone for the crimes you've been forced to commit" "wonder again how you got yourself mixed up in this business.  It seems that just yesterday you were a simple trader, and now you are an indentured assassin"}.You are met by a four man Bureau team who quickly take control of the prisoner after you dissolve your protective shell and they direct you to a nearby Bureau official."Good work," he says, handing you a datapad showing your newly-clean Federation record on it after hearing your story.  "That should cover any damage done to your record.

"That should cover your expenses.

If the aim of the Bureau to bring all of humanity together wasn't so laudable, it almost wouldn't be worth it" "find yourself wondering again how you long this whole campaign will take.  It seems that just yesterday you were a simple trader, and now you are an honored assassin, taking the lives of those who would keep humanity fragmented"}.HYou are met by a four man Bureau team who quickly take control of the prisoner after you dissove your protective shell and they direct you to a nearby Bureau official."Good work," he says, handing you a credit chip with a few credits on it.

After you all celebrate each others' kills, you head off to find the dockmaster to see if you are going to be recompensed for your services.  He thanks you heartily when you enter his office, and pays you the sum of 25,000 credits for your efforts.You and your fellow warriors greet each other with gleeful bear-hugs and a lot of shouting.  After you all celebrate each others' kills, and laugh at the ineptitude of the alleged Moashi 'veterans', you quietly head off to find the dockmaster to see if you are going to be recompensed for your services.  He praises you heartily when you enter his office, and pays you the sum of 25,000 credits for your efforts.You are met by a young gray-cloaked warrior upon landing."I wanted to meet the {G "man" "woman"} who is becoming the legend," he smiles in the quiet manner all the Nil'kemorya seem to have, "so I offered to pass on to you our thanks for your services, and inform you that 100,000 credits have been transferred into your account."Once again, as this warrior walks away, you are left standing there with the same unanswered questions as before.VDespite the possibility of death, you are still amazed that the entire battle went off to the dulcet tones of Debris Field chanting "Rock On!" and "Fire it up!"  In between their noise, you managed to fend off the attackers and make it to <RST>.  Truth be told you wouldn't care if the band had been killed, but the money's good and now you just have to watch the show and get paid.You are standing at the front of the stage, looking for would-be unsavory types (and seeing them everywhere, since none of the fans seem to have washed in a decade) when you notice a commotion on stage.  The lead singer appears to be on fire, as smoke and steam pours out of his joints and his mouth.  Suddenly, it occurs to you that he's a robot, and he isn't singing the garbage coming from the speakers at all.The crowd notices too, and you see a number of techs and spacies rush on stage to haul the malfunctioning unit away.  Next minute, Sly Styles appears to the hoots and jeers of his disgruntled audience.  He tries to calm things down, but the situation is well out of hand.  You quickly vault onto the stage, grab Styles and hustle him off amid a barrage of empty cups and cans.  A riot ensues.After the Federal troops have calmed everything down, you make your way back to your ship.  You have your money, but it seems that Styles is on his way to prison for false advertising and fraud.  The Feds let you go, considering that you only joined this motley crew recently, and they kindly let you keep your pay.  You conclude that if this is show business, you are better off avoiding it."Thank you for taking us on our journey, <PN>," Jerry smiles.In the time he has been on your ship you have grown quite fond of the man, and his quiet manner.  He hands you a credit chip and tells you that future generations of spacefarers will probably take routes to new systems simply because of the research you have helped with your service.  You wonder about what the probe will find 'out there'.  Perhaps the universe that you are beginning to know so well will only turn out to be a corner of what is really in existence.  Perhaps the probe will be the first human contact with an alien race.  Only time will tell.KYou set down on <RST>.  As you cycle the hatch you see Shard heading towards you."Wait for word from me in the bar," he says. "I have a feeling we are just in time.  I bribed the dockmaster, and he says the convoy is scheduled to arrive in about an hour.  I'll double-check and let you know."
Twenty minutes later, you cycle the hatch closed.  Shard sits down, and produces a bottle."I have something to tell you," he begins.  "I am not a free-lance investigator.  I am a deep cover operative working for the Heraan House, the most noble house in the Auroran Empire."  You are stunned.  While you knew that there was something strange about Shard, you would never in your wildest dreams have considered this possibility.  "I have been in Federation space for fifteen years now," he continues "and have been sending information to, and doing missions for, the Heraan House the entire time.  My father was a Thurokiir of the house, and I am a shard of his Obsidian Heart."The artifacts we have liberated rightly belong to the Vell-os and, contrary to popular belief, the Aurorans do look after peoples other than their own.  I have approached you  because you have shown yourself to be a {G"man" "woman"} of honor.  To not treat you as such would be a great insult.  Therefore your records with the Federation will never show your involvement in this heist, nor shall the Federation ever know of your involvement here."You ask Shard why he trusts you so much, considering the fact that you could sell him out to the Federation at a moments notice.His eyes turn cold."Firstly," he says "I know that you have never sold out an individual before.  To do so would be an incredible change of personality for you.  Heraan intel agree with my conclusions.  You may think that you are anonymous, but your Federal file was an open book to us.  The Feds have not even encrypted it that heavily.  Secondly, if you were to 'sell me out' as you put it," he takes a sip of his drink, eyeing you over the rim of his glass, "the early warnings I have set up would give me ample time to escape the Bureau snatch squad sent to capture me, and a number of Heraan hit teams would continue to hunt you down wherever you went until you were dead.  Only you would be in a position to betray me.  No other."You quickly tell Shard that you would not betray him, not because of the threat of Heraan retribution, but as a matter of honor.He smiles.  "I know that, <PN>.  If you ever go into Heraan space, know that you will be treated with the respect you deserve."He stands, grasps your hand, collects the artifacts and leaves you a credit chip.  Part of you is sorry to see Shard go, but another is glad to be out of his immediate orbit.  Danger follows him like a ghost, and for a little while at least, you will be glad not to be in the firing line.s"Well," Charengo smiles, "here is your pay."He hands you a chip and you both watch the men unload the equipment.  The clients are meeting their families and friends, showing them the staged holos and waving their arms around, miming the 'awesome' shots that killed the dread beasts.  Only the fourth client has any claim on the events he's describing, and you and Charengo laugh quietly to yourselves.Only a few short hours later all the equipment is unloaded and Charengo bids you goodbye.  You don't think you'll ever go hunting Cunjo again, but at least you can say you have done it.5Two Polaris officials meet you when you land, one garbed in all gray, one in black.  In a blur of sudden motion the gray one attacks you, and the last thing you see is the light fading around the edges of your vision.When you wake up, you are greeted by the same black-garbed Polaris."What they have done to you is terrible," she says.  "We have done all we can, but some of the mental scars you have will remain with you forever.  We will not allow you to stay on the off chance that the Federation attacks us using your presence here as a pretence, but we wish you well in your travels."With that she helps you out of the bed and back to your ship.For the first time in many months, you feel a little freedom now that the Polaris have removed the explosives from your brain.You are dragged out of your ship by a team of soldiers into the spaceport to where Commander Krane is waiting."Find the pictures," she snaps and several other soldiers immediately head into your ship returning moments later with the pictures you took of the Wraith cannon and the Wraithii.  The leader of the searchers comes over and whispers something to Commander Krane and you can see her anger growing."You were scanned!" she hisses angrily, and your eyes burn in shame.  She turns back to the soldiers with her, "We have to move now on the Polaris, head back to HQ and start getting the necessary people together."The soldiers all nod and all head off at a jog while Commander Krane turns her gaze back on you."As for you," she murmurs in a deathly quiet voice, "I should have known better than to trust something like this to you.  Meet me here sometime in the next few weeks, and then we will see what is to be done with you."lAs soon as you land a dozen or so engineers begin swarming all over your craft demanding all your logs and taking all kinds of readings.  Shaking your head you comply with all their demands without comment until you see both Sharon and Krane making their way over."Did you not hear us when we told you not to destroy the Gunboats?" Sharon asks in an acid voice, "Did I use too many syllables for you?""{G"He" "She"} is a little too good at his job," Krane smiles slyly.  "Whenever things get rough {G"he" "she"} bulldozes {G"his" "her"} way through.""I'm still not very impressed," hisses Sharon angrily, glaring at you.  "Regardless of this {G"cowboy's" "cowgirl's"} efforts, I believe we have enough preliminary data which shows that the RAGE is a very competent ship in her class so we will start production immediately.  I suggest that you teach your 'agent' how to listen to orders.""Don't presume to tell the Bureau anything," murmurs Krane with a dangerously happy smile, "we might take it the wrong way."Both you and Krane smile as Sharon is forced to humbly nod and back away.Morning finds you in a small bed in the home of Michaleen.  You see him enter the room with a huge plate of steaming food, which makes your fragile stomach perform a couple of small flips.  He thrusts it under your nose, and insists that you eat.  As you weakly push the food down your gullet, Michaleen tells you that all the young men of the town must go to the bride's family home and collect her dowry, so they can deliver it to the newly-weds, {G"and you have been invited to help" "whilst all the women, and the married folk enjoy a gentle day of art and song"}."In fact," he says through a mouthful of his own breakfast, "I've been told not to {G"show up unless I have you in tow" "show my face around here any more unless I escort you to the festivities safely"}."You readily agree and spend another very enjoyable day in the company of these strange and hospitable folk."Michaleen Houge, you worthless muck-shoveller," Pennant steps forward, casting back his overcoat to reveal a sawn-off shot-blaster, "You have a lot of nerve showing your ugly face about here.  We was tipped off you'd be droppin' by, so I thought I'd get myself a little payback while I'm here.  Boss wants his money as well."  He starts to walk forward.  The men behind you begin to close in."If I don't get out of this in one piece," Michaleen whispers urgently, "get back to New Ireland and find Eamon Flannigan.  Tell him what happened, and that I'm sorry about this."The men behind you charge, and Pennant opens fire with the shot-blaster.  Michaleen pulls a hidden blaster from his cloak and returns fire, and you turn to face the charging men behind you.  You fire at one of them, but you feel a sudden pain in your back.  You fall into unconsciousness, and the ensuing blackness is the heaviest you have ever known.The next day you meet with Flannigan in his office.  For the commander of a mercenary unit you are surprised that he has no personal body guards, but as you enter his office, you see him training with some other men in a side area.  As you watch, you see ten men rush him, only to be repulsed by him.  He moves in a way that you have seen no other man ever move.  He weaves around them as if he controlled their movements as well as his own, and that each step taken was part of some elaborate (and painful) dance.  By the time you begin to piece together what your eyes are telling you, the man has moved on further.  It is amazing to behold.Within moments he has defeated the men.  You expect them to be smashed...broken...bloody; yet they stand, slowly for some, but they are not injured beyond possible bruises."Better, gentlemen, much better.  Now go and practice among yourselves.  I have business to attend to."  He turns and walks towards you.  "I can see you are impressed," Flannigan waves behind his head at the practice mat, "The skills of a mercenary are varied.  Some situations require force, others non-force.  It is something I learned during my time with the Aurorans.  The House Heraan use a specific style of Martial Arts, which they call the Heron Style.  I am a master, but I have started teaching my men here a variation of it.  It is an amazing system."You nod in agreement, and ask what the principal basis is."In learning Heron style, you are taught to read and direct the 'Weave' of combat," he replies quietly.  "Subconsciously, all of us fight to a pattern and rhythm.  Heron Style teaches us to detect it and control it.  It isn't so much that you defeat your opponent, but he defeats himself, if you force the "weave" to do so.  It is hard to explain, but once felt, and mastered, it makes all combat easier, from one on one, to mammoth battles between hundreds of ships.  There is one teacher Karlaekar, to whom the most promising students are sent.  It is said he imprints the ability to read and control the 'weave' on the student subconsciously.  This makes their 'weave' unreadable, and therefore very dangerous."You nod, even though most of what Flannigan has said escapes your understanding."So, tell me what happened when you and Michaleen arrived in Sol.  Don't leave anything out."  You tell Flannigan what happened.  By the time you have finished, he has gone white with rage."Bastards," he says under his breath.  "I know that Mic wasn't entirely blameless.  But I sent him into that situation.  I needed information on McGowan's organization.  I needed to see what sort of man he was.  I guess now I know.  I made a terrible error in judgement.  But so has McGowan.  His man Pennant will die, and so will his Sol operations."You ask Flannigan if there is anything that you can do to help, as you want to avenge Michaleen as well.  He tells you to wait for him in the Bar.  He will let you know in a little while.0You remember standing guard while Flynn quickly set a number of microfusion charges before both of you returned to the <PSN>.  As you passed over the site, Flynn depressed the detonator, and the entire wreck disappeared in a ball of white light, rapidly expanding to a sphere of flaming debris.  The hulk was simply vaporized.You and Flynn report the details of your assault to Flannigan, who grins happily at the result."That should upset our friend McGowan somewhat," he says a little cheekily.  "He just lost a sizeable portion of his drug production capability.  It took him almost a year to set up the site, and it took the two of you and a strike team an hour or so to utterly destroy it.  Wait for me in the bar, I'll have something else for you to do in a few hours.""We saw your handiwork on the news," Flannigan smiles as he meets you at the hatch.  "I especially liked the bit when the authorities tried to take the credit for the destruction of a large shipment of drugs, and breaking the smuggling ring.  Funny thing about crooked cops.  If something too big happens, they take down everybody, get promotions and medals, and sleep well at night knowing that they have heaps of cash and have still done their jobs."  Flannigan shakes his head, and you wonder just how the police and security forces were tipped off."Go and get some rest in a real bed," he finishes with a warm smile, "and take some time to wind down.  The next stage of the operation is going to be tricky, so I'll need some time to set it up."You cannot believe your eyes.  When you land on New Ireland, you can barely believe what has happened to it.  Only a few weeks ago this world was a green, lush planet full of the beauties of both man and nature, now it is little more than a smoldering ruin of a world.Eiric, who during the course of your journey has gained your respect for what he has been trying to do to break McGowan's stranglehold on what was originally intended to be an organization to protect everyday traders from the depredations of Bureaucratic idiocy, steps forward and quietly puts his hand on your shoulder in support."Perhaps we had better be searching for your colleagues elsewhere," suggests Eiric in gruff yet tactful voice.  You nod, remembering what Eamon said about looking up his friend Professor F Cook before turning back to your ship and telling everyone to get back inside with more than a few unshed tears glimmering in your eyes."We have a number of sources amongst the Associated Guild of Free Traders," he informs you, "but, in the interests of our security I don't think I can tell you any more than that."At hearing this your heart sinks."However," he says more positively, and you lean forward expectantly, "if I were you, I would be looking for a man who runs an illegal ship outfitting operation on Viking in the Tichel system.  I have a feeling he may be exactly what you are looking for..."With that 'Geoff' turns on his heel and walks away.  For a moment you cannot help but feel that maybe he is talking about your Uncle Olaf whom you haven't seen for a few years now...!When you open your hatch you are greeted by a heavily muscled man covered from head to toe with layer upon layer of savage looking tattoos.  He steps forward."I am Techerakh," he introduces himself quietly.  "You have word from my brother Archindar, whom you would know as Flannigan?"After a moment of confusion you nod and begin relating the recent events concerning the Wild Geese.  It takes several minutes, but he listens without comment, watching you calmly.  When you finish, he nods slightly, as the silence grows between you."This is unfortunate," he acknowledges with quiet sympathy.  "The Archekro are fine warriors, and do not deserve to be betrayed this way."You look on in confusion."We have a tradition amongst the warriors of the Empire," Techerakh explains mildly, "of honoring those people and units that have distinguished themselves by giving them a name of honor.  After the battle in which Archindar led the Wild Geese to defeat an Auroran raid and save Commander Raczak, those that survived honored you all by giving you all the name 'Archekro' which means 'they who dance with blood and war'."Regardless," he continues, returning to the matter at hand, "we must address the problems before us.  I am prepared to offer the Archekro sanctuary here in Heraan space in return for their services in defending it.  But first, I want to test the mettle of those on whom we will be depending on to help vouchsafe our borders, for while I have heard that you are all capable warriors, it is better to see these things for yourself."Drop by the station 'Dominance' in the Heraan Cov system sometime in the next few weeks," he finishes quietly, "and there may be a mission for you."With that, he turns and walks away with the graceful stride of a born warrior."So," he says, turning to Michaleen and eyeing him wryly, "Not 12 hours ago we beat off a well-planned and well-conducted raid by ships that appear to be untraceable, and then you come home looking like a whipped dog.  Why am I not surprised?  When I told you to try and infiltrate McGowan's organization I didn't mean you had to piss off all his lackeys in the process.  Let me guess, you had a run-in with Pennant?"Michaleen nods, his eyes downcast."All right," Flannigan nods as if having made a major decision.  "Meet me in the bar in a few hours, and I'll detail you a new set of orders.  In the mean time Michaleen, go and get your training gear on.  If you're going to get into all these fights, the least I can do is show you how to survive them without having to go through major surgery all the time."Michaleen sighs and despondently turns away, and you notice a quick smile crossing Flannigan's face.  He looks at you and shakes his head after Michaleen leaves."There are days," he grins, still shaking his head, "when I swear I could throttle that boy.  If he wasn't so damn good at what he does, I reckon I probably would have by now.  Regardless, he seems to have taken a shine to you, and whatever his faults are, he's a fine judge of character.  If you want to drop by the bar as well, I could use you, if only to try and keep Michaleen from straying too far into the wilderness."-Almost before you land, someone has picked the lock on your hatch and in minutes a small group of men carrying all sorts of weapons have stormed into your cockpit and taken you prisoner.  They carry you through the spaceport to a set of offices just off the main structure of the spaceport and throw you into what appears to be a conference room of sorts.  Inside you see seated in a plain, yet obviously comfortable, chair a man slightly more than medium height and of slim build.  There is something almost hauntingly familiar about the man, but you cannot put your finger on it."If my information is correct, Captain <PN>," he begins pleasantly, "you have recently come from the planet called New Ireland in the Tuatha system.  Now, as I am sure you have guessed by now, my name is McGowan, and at the moment, as Guild-master of the Associated Guild of Free Traders, I am not terribly impressed with a group of people, known as the Wild Geese, that hail from that area of space.  Now tell me, why should I allow you to leave this station alive?"You take a few moments to tell McGowan of your most recent meeting with Flannigan and of the data-cube containing his peace proposal.  When you have finished speaking McGowan stares at you for several moments."Meet me in the bar in a couple of hours," he dismisses you indifferently, his urbane manner sends shivers of something akin to recognition down your spine.  "By then I will have made my decision regarding this 'truce'."With a small wave of his hand his muscular henchmen grab you and turf you back out into the spaceport.  With a few muttered curses you decide that discretion would probably be the better part of valor in this case, and you head off to find the local bar, wondering what it is about the man that seems so familiar...Toward the end of the night, Eamon calls for quiet, and an expectant hush falls over the bar patrons."Friends," he says "You all know <PN>, and have heard what a wonderful {g"fella he" "lass she"} is!"There is a roar from the crowd, and you feel yourself blush."You've heard that it was {g"himself" "herself"} that did well for Michaleen, and fought beside him, using {g"his" "her"} head to break the feet of {g"his" "her"} foes," again the roar, this time accompanied by good-natured laughter.  "Well, it is my great pleasure to bestow upon <PN> the Order of the Red Branch!"The crowd goes ballistic, and you are pushed forward by a wave of hands patting you upon the back.  Flannigan takes you by the arm, and instructs you to kneel before him.He takes a huge sword of highly polished steel and places it upon your shoulder, then the other intoning "I dub thee {g"Sir" "Lady"} <PN>, Knight of the Red Branch, keeper of the Blood of Cuchalain.  Stand and be recognized."The roaring of the crowd is deafening, and you stand and are presented with a small brooch.  Looking at it, you see it depicts a Goose in flight, surrounded by small three-leafed plants, all set over two crossed swords.  Tears mist your eyes, and you feel the arms of your new family embrace you.Next day Flannigan sees you off at the spaceport."Don't forget what I told you, now," he embraces you warmly.  "Stop by every now and then and I'll probably have a job for you.  And if you ever get into trouble, just you come back here, and we'll take care of it for you."You smile and tell him that you will, and step aboard your ship.  He waves farewell, and before long the stars fill your viewports, and you leave New Ireland behind...for the time being..You close your eyes in remembrance of a man with the quick wit and even quicker smile who greeted you as a brother.  After a moment of gut-wrenching reverie, you open your eyes, ready to do whatever has to be done to avenge all that has been done to the Wild Geese and the people they protect.Flannigan draws you away from the crowds in the spaceport."That's why I'm glad you returned as quickly as you did," he explains, nodding in appreciation.  "Meet me in the bar in one hour, and I shall have something for you."H"Well," Charengo smiles, "here is your pay.  Sorry about your injuries, but these things happen when you hunt Cunjo.  The bastards just learn your patterns from successive hunts, some sort of race memory I guess.  Anyway, hope I haven't put you off too much!  Still, there are advantages to this.  From now on, the story of your prowess will pass from person to person.  It takes guts to take down a Cunjo on your own, let alone two.  Before too long, you'll be known as a 'Cunjo Hunter.'  Nice working with you."He hands you a chip and you both watch the men unload the equipment.  The clients are meeting their families and friends, showing them the staged holos and waving their arms around, miming the 'awesome' shots that killed the dread beasts.  Only the fourth client has any claim on the events he's describing, and you and Charengo laugh quietly to yourselves.Only a few short hours later all the equipment is unloaded and Charengo bids you goodbye.  You don't think you'll ever go hunting Cunjo again, but at least you can say you have done it.You take your time going through your post-flight routine, savoring the feeling of victory.  When you finish, you head out to meet your defeated opponent."Even before I spoke to you," gushes the Heraan warrior admiringly, "I knew you would be a worthy opponent.  You have inspired me to train even harder and maybe next time I can provide you with an even tougher contest.""Obviously," you reply graciously, "some of you Aurorans are as gracious in defeat as you are capable in battle."The young warrior nods in acceptance of your compliment before walking away, obviously pleased at your kind words.}You take your time going through your post-flight routine, savoring the feeling of victory.  When you finish, you head out to meet your defeated opponent."It seems that some of you Federationers are even better than they say you are," says the young Tekel warrior quietly.  "I will train even harder and maybe next time I can defeat you.""Obviously," you reply graciously, "some of you Aurorans are as gracious in defeat as you are capable in battle."The young warrior stares at you thoughtfully for a moment before nodding in acceptance of your compliment before walking away, deep in thought.'You take your time going through your post-flight routine, savoring the feeling of victory.  When you finish, you head out to meet your defeated opponent."It seems that not all Federationers are as weak as they say," says the now surly young warrior as a grinning crowd of what looks like his compatriots."Obviously," you drawl in return, "not all you Aurorans are as capable as you think you are."The young warrior stares at you hatefully for a moment before storming off amidst the laughter of his friends."Okay, here's the deal," Folstam continues.  "The Guild is prepared to offer you membership, and a share of the reward if you can destroy an Auroran ship named the <SN> that has been nosing around this system and its surrounds.  The military is not prepared to spend the enormous resources required to locate this single ship so they have posted a bounty and that's where we come in.  We're a little thin on the ground right now so we're offering the job to you.  Simply put, if you want to get your share of the bounty and become a member of the Bounty Hunters Guild, you have to go out, find the <SN> and destroy it.  Then to collect your payment find the Guild offices on the Kane Band."The actual bounty from the Federation government is 20000 credits, but the Guild will take fifty percent in a one-off membership fee.  If you succeed they will give you clearance to access all the bounties through the Mission BBS' every time you land."YIn the last few weeks a rogue Auroran ship, the <SN>, has slipped past Federation border patrols and has been harassing ships in this and the surrounding systems.

"Sounds fairly straight forward, but I can tell you that it won't be that easy."You can expect the Aurorans to test you all the way and probably all the way back," he warns seriously.  "You see, they have a warrior culture, and they will judge us by our ability to fight and survive as much as they will on our actual proposals.  From their point of view, if you can't survive, then what hope have you of working in their space?"Folstam shifts in his chair, leaning a little closer, "A word about the negotiators," he grins wryly.  "Treat them with respect, but be aware that they are desk-jockeys.  They will not know the first thing about space-flight, and you had better watch that they don't panic and get in your way when the fighting starts."Good luck <PN>, you have your work cut out for you.""Druckmar was not only my Battle brother, but my kinsman as well.  You fought with great skill, and I know that I can nominate you to become a warrior." Achmar continues.  "You look puzzled.  It is an old tradition, but it is still legal.  Druckmar knew the dangers of a warrior's life, and I know he was prepared, as we all are."You carouse long into the night, sharing stories and drinks, and Achmar bestows an honor upon you that somehow remained clear in your mind."If you ever return, come to Heraan, and," he slurred magnanimously, "I will make sure that you are offered the test to become a warrior.  If you survive, I will gladly call you my brother."In the morning you wake up to see your three passengers hovering over you."We must get back to Earth," they start excitedly.  "We must pass on the news so that the Guild can start on its new Chapter House!"You wince, wondering why you had to have such irritating travelling companions, but you get up and begin readying your ship.In the last few months the lone pirate vessel, known as the <SN>, has managed to avoid all attempts at capture by all local authorities and the Federation Navy.

He tells you that this will be your home for the next few months as you learn the basics of being a warrior.On your first day of training you come to hate that room, where every morning Techerakh will destroy any belief you had in your abilities with his obviously superior martial skills.  But as the weeks pass and Techerakh begins instructing you on warrior philosophy and the hierarchy of the Heraan House, that hate slowly turns to fondness.  You learn that as Thurokiir he is one of the two best warriors in the service of the Heraan House and that he earned the tattoo of a stylized Heron by being a master of unarmed combat.Nearly four months to the day after starting your training, Techerakh informs you that you are ready to begin your initiation."Go to the planet Arado in the Erante system and hunt down a Cunjo, kill it and bring its head back as proof," he intones simply.  "If you survive, you will be honored as a warrior{b7880 ".  This should be easy for a Cunjo Hunter like yourself." "."}""I never doubted you," he chuckles.  "I don't actually know that much about the mission.  Apparently the Aurorans have a small pirate problem with a particular sector of their space.  It seems that two of the major Auroran Families are saying that it is the others job to deal with these outlaws." Jack shrugs his shoulders."Apparently that is where you come in," he continues.  "They want you to do something about it, exactly what, I'm not so sure."That's it, I'm afraid.  To get any more information, you are going to have to get it from the new Chapter House on Aurora."And while you're at it you have to go and pick up Bindi," Folstam smiles.  "She is going to be the new receptionist for the Auroran Chapter House and she needs a lift.  Seeing that you have to go that way, the Day-Master would appreciate you giving her a ride.  You can pick her up on <DST> in the <DSY> system."Jack stands up and sticks out his hand."Good luck.",Apparently the disgraced warrior Kaniuhk has been organizing the myriad fallen warriors into a formidable fighting force and neither the Tekel or Dani Houses are prepared to deal with him, with both families claiming that it is the others responsibility.Intelligence on his exact whereabouts on the asteroid '<RST>' is sketchy, but is known to frequent the bar virtually every afternoon for several hours.He is to be captured and returned alive to the Chapter House on Aurora in order to stand trial for his crimes.mYou switch to rapid fire and blast away at the warriors, putting rounds down range and forcing them to put their heads down or have them taken off.  As you get closer some of the warriors begin to shoot at you, but without a second thought you turn your field of fire to them and take them down.  Blaster bolts fly past your head and graze your arm.  You go to cover, slam home a fresh charge clip, and hammer away at your foes.  Soon, you have a clear approach, but are pretty sure that your mark has escaped.  Cursing, you break cover, and burst through the doorway.No sooner have you leaped through than a storm of fire erupts all around you.  You switch you selector back to single, power level to stun, and go to ground to start picking off the enemy.  Once you take stock of the situation, you become aware that there are only a few targets in the room.  Watching for their muzzle flash, you pick them off before fumbling for the light switch.  You quickly cast about the inert warriors and find Kaniuhk.  He is deep in blaster induced unconsciousness.  Hurling him over your shoulder, you quickly make your escape.After dodging some warriors who were obviously looking for you, and having to put a couple more into Kaniuhk to keep him under, you finally reach the safety of your ship.  It seems like days since you left, but in actual truth it has only been a couple of hours.As soon as you get on board you secure Kaniuhk, slapping some leg irons and para-drugs into him to make sure he wont disturb you.  You strap in, and blast off, probably committing a number of port violations on the way.vIn the last few weeks the lone pirate vessel, called the <SN>, has managed to avoid the constant patrolling by Auroran warriors and has been harassing ships in this and the surrounding systems.

"Hang on, I've got it written down here."You wait while he reaches into a belt pouch before handing over a data crystal."All we want you to do is to meet with whoever is in charge over there and find out what they're like," he continues.  "Shouldn't be too dangerous, but the Polaris do like to be left alone, so just keep an eye out.  Remember, the Polaris have technology centuries ahead of ours, so think about running before fighting if things start getting out of hand.  When you've finished all that, head back to <RST> to get a little cash reimbursement and a debrief."He stands up, slugging down the rest of his drink ."Good seeing you again <PN>, and good luck."After finishing your drink you head back to your beloved <PSN> and read the data crystal he gave you, to see that the Day-Master wants you to go to <DST> in the <DSY> system.  Looks like a long trip.	"It's actually something of a running problem," sighs Folstam.  "You see, our Guild works along very similar lines to the 'Guild of Free Traders', read pirates, but we operate within the bounds of the law.  They aren't so constrained and they make a lot more money.  Therein lies the attraction."Once you becomes a competent bounty hunter," he explains, "you have all the skills necessary to become a very rich pirate.  Every few years we lose someone, but, as far as I can tell, no senior members have gone over for about four decades.  And nobody has ever gone so far as to deliberately target other Guild members."But that is exactly what Gareth Drisbon and his friends have been doing," Jack continues, slamming his fist on the table.  "I want you to go to <DST> in the <DSY> system and pick him up.

If you believe their propaganda one of their leaders is the former head of Federation Intel.  Regardless, whoever taught them how to run a tight ship did a good job; the Bureau would love to bust them up but thus far have been unable to."They wanted to meet me specifically," he explains, "but I told them that I would be sending you, so there should be no problems there.  They want you to travel to <DST> in the <DSY> system and meet them."Be wary of Federation patrols.  You can be sure that whatever the motivation, the Federation won't like it that we've been working with their enemies.  People tend to disappear into the clutches of the Bureau when they get caught doing things like that."Anything you get, bring back to Corrin as soon as you get it," insists Jack.  "I have a feeling that what they've got will be fairly important."Good luck <PN>, and watch your back."Blaster bolts whine around you, and you and Jack roll to cover.  Patrons rush the exits, and outside you can see more Feds trying to push their way through."Jack, we gotta go," you yell, returning fire and trying not to hit any innocent people."Just hold them off for a few more seconds," Jack yells above the din of battle.  "I'm working on the walls here.""Hurry it up Jack, I'm running out of ammo," you yell.Folstam bellows at you to get down, and as you hit the deck an explosion rocks the room.  The bulk of the Federation Troopers fall to the ground as a concussions wave hurls bits of plascrete and flying debris at them.Jack leads the way as you burst out through the dust and smoke.  Troopers are pouring in from all directions, but for the moment you are able to hide in the confusion.  Suddenly, a trooper starts to open fire and Jack is caught in a hail of Lascannon rounds.  You grab him, but can tell that its too late.  His side is missing several large chunks, and the smell of cauterized flesh is strong in the air."<PN>, you've got to get clear," he gasps as you pull him into cover "You know that I'm done for, so get out of here as fast as you can.  Those Bureau bastards won't get me without a fight!"You share a look of understanding, and bolt off down the promenade stowing your blaster."Long live the Rebellion!" You hear Jack yell, followed by an station rocking explosion.  You don't look back, but decide to throw your lot in with the Rebels.Locate and destroy the <SN> and then collect your bounty at the Guild offices on the Kane Band.Take the Guild negotiators from <DST> to <RST> to talk with the Aurorans about opening a Guild Chapter House there.Return to <RST> with your passengers to share the news of your successful mission with the Guild.Locate and disable the <SN> in order to capture its Captain and Crew so that they can be brought to trial.Travel to <DST> in the <DSY> system, hunt and kill a Cunjo before returning to <RST> with its head as proof in order to become a Heraan House warrior.}Go to <RST> and take Bindi with you after picking her up from <DST> in the <DSY> system.Go to the asteroid <RST> in the <RSY> system and capture Kaniuhk returning him to the Chapter House on Aurora to receive your payment.Locate and destroy the <SN> in and then collect your bounty at the Guild offices on Aurora.Go to <DST> in the <DSY> system, meet the Polaris leaders and find out a little more about them before returning to <RST>.yGo to <DST> in the <DSY> system, pick up Gareth Drisbon and bring him back to <RST>.Find the renegade bounty hunter in the '<SN>', destroy him and head back to the Earth offices to receive your payment.Travel to <DST> in the <DSY> system to meet with the rebels and obtain whatever information they wanted to pass on.

"Is this the <PSN>, and are you Captain <PN>?"You look skyward for a moment and then ask if they are the Guild negotiators."Ah, yes," replies their spokesperson, looking a little uncomfortable.  "Um.. Captain, if it's all right, could you show us where to put our gear and give us an idea of what to expect?  You see, ah... none of us have actually been into space and we really have no idea about, ah... what we should be doing."You look skyward a second time before closing the access panel you were working on and giving them a quick tour of the ship followed by a rundown of the procedures you want them to follow in any emergency.  Never before in your experience has it taken so long for a group of people to learn that when things start going wrong they should strap themselves in and shut up.After setting explosives on the hull of the disabled ship and watching the resulting explosion you dash in and take control of the flight deck of the ship amidst the smoke and flames.Neither the Captain or the crew is in any condition to resist as they all look as if they have spent the last few minutes being pummelled by a polar bear.  You stow them in your cargo hold under lock and key for the trip back to Sol.After setting explosives on the hull of the disabled ship and watching the resulting explosion you dash onto the flight deck of the <SN> amidst the smoke and flames.Although neither the Captain or the crew is in any condition to resist after the firefight they have just endured they somehow manage to raise the effort to fight back.  You spend the better part of the next hour subduing the valiant and skilful defense of the warriors of this vessel.You stow the few survivors in your cargo hold under lock and key and immediately head off to find your first aid kit to take care of your own not insignificant injuries.kYou have an uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach as you set down.  Despite the fact that you know you should be able to kill the Cunjo, it still doesn't help to think that they are the fiercest natural predator in the Auroran empire.  You set up your weapons, a collection of archaic spears, swords and axes in your hunting harness, so you can reach any of it at a moments notice and wait for the Cunjo to get your scent.After what seems like an endless wait, you hear the rustle of a large animal stalking through the forest.  You reach behind you, taking a firm grip on a wickedly barbed spear, just as a snarling vision of death bursts from the undergrowth.The Cunjo bounds towards you, teeth as long as most daggers jutting from its slathering jaws.  The mere sight of it causes your blood to turn to ice, and you can smell rotten meat on its breath as it roars at you.  The sound washes over you, snapping you out of your reverie.  You stab forward with the spear, only to see the Cunjo smash the shaft with a bat of its paws.  You leap back, luckily turning a disembowelling swipe at your stomach into a mere slashing.  It causes you to suck in your breath, and your blood splatters to a nearby tree.  You decide it is time for more aggressive action.With desperation, you grab the nearest weapon you have, a large combination Axe-maul and swing it into the path of the Cunjo's next attack.  It howls in agony as it's paw bounces off the metal with an audible BONG!  Making the most of the break in the animal momentum, you step forward, and swing the axe.  Your training has paid off and you smash the axe head deep into the Cunjo's chest cavity with a snapping of ribs.You quickly decapitate the beast, drag yourself inside your ship and take off.  You are twitching with excess adrenaline, but you have never felt so alive in all your life.%You walk off your ship wondering what Bindi looks like when you hear a discreet cough off to your left.  You turn to see a slim young brunette smiling in your direction.  She comes over and introduces herself as Bindi.After you show her around your ship she begins telling you a little about herself.  You learn that she has been involved with the Guild since her early teens when Folstam rescued her from starvation on the impoverished Brass in the Glimmer system.  Since then she has worked as a low-level courier between Guild members, operated as a secure contact and spent a few years studying under Corrin in the Federation office.Despite her youthful enthusiasm, you sense a deep intelligence behind her words, as if she is deliberately trying to draw you into conversation.  To your surprise she succeeds, and while you go through your pre-flight checklist you find yourself telling her many of the things that you haven't told anyone for years.You make a mental note to pay close attention to this young lady.After setting explosives on the hull of the disabled ship and watching the resulting explosion you dash in and take control of the flight deck of the ship amidst the smoke and flames.Neither the Captain or the crew is in any condition to resist as they all look as if they have spent the last few minutes being pummelled by a polar bear.  You stow them in your cargo hold under lock and key for the trip back to Aurora.You feel a little bit nervous as you complete your post-flight checks and cycle the hatch.  You aren't very sure what to expect of the Polaris, but from what you have seen their technology makes your ship look like a dinosaur.  You exit your ship to see an elderly brown-robed woman flanked by two gray-robed men who have a frightening aura of stillness about them."<PN>,thank you for making such a long and arduous journey ," she begins, "I am Bis Andreya, and I am here to inform you that we have no need of the services of your Guild."She holds up a hand to forestall your protests."The crime rate amongst the Polaris is virtually nil," she explains, "and we are more than capable of defending our borders," she shrugs."That is why we met you here," she continues, "as we felt that there was no need to waste your time any further.  You have made a long trip here for no return, and you have a long trip back.  But before you go, please, feel free to wander around so that you can make a full report back to your superiors."After she leaves, you wander around this technological heaven.  You and your achievements shrink into insignificance next to it.UAlmost before you land you launch yourself out of your seat and into this station.  You know something of the rules by which this place operates and you know that what you are going to do breaks any number of them.  If you are too slow you'll end up as yet another pirate casualty.You sprint up to the palatial residence of Gareth Drisbon and shoot down the door, killing the door guards standing behind them with your blistering hail of fire.You leap through the shattered remains of the door, laying down enough blaster fire to make most of Drisbons' hired thugs to keep their heads down.  You reach into your 'suit and flip out a large stun grenade.  You hurl it at your foes, and dive behind cover.  A huge flash nearly blinds you, and a rolling concussion wave washes over you.  You quickly leap up, and run past the inert forms of Drisbon's heavies.  Dashing up stairs, you find Drisbon coming down the hallway, armed with a wicked looking scatter blaster.  You dive, firing from a full stretch, your blaster set to stun.  You feel the heat of a number of blaster shots passing over and under your body.  Luckily, none of them punch through you, but it is a close shave.  Your bolts punch into Drisbons' body, and he flies backwards, falling into a deep unconsciousness.  You quickly grab him and head for your ship.Outside you see that the pirate overlords of Harbor have already sent some of their minions down to investigate, and you are forced into a pitched gun battle just to reach your ship.Once inside, you slam the engines up to full, and you make your getaway.You find your targets hideout fairly easily and you quickly gather together pretty much everything you can carry to take it back to Guild offices in the Kane Band.On arrival you are greeted by two men.  You recognize one as being Dr. Oriallo Pentecost, a former Federation Councillor, and the only honest one in recent years!  If he is alive you wonder what other 'rebel myths' are true.  The other man you don't recognize, but he wears the robes of a high ranking member of the Church of Krim-Hwa.After entering a small room you learn that the other man is Cardinal Vardy de Valera."Our agents have uncovered evidence that the Bureau is harboring people with prices on their heads," begins Dr. Pentecost without delay.  "We think that they are being coerced into working for the Bureau in exchange for protection from your organization."The information is all contained in here," he hands you a data crystal, "we hope it helps you in some way."I apologize if this seems rude," he continues, "but we must be on our way as we do not want the Bureau getting any solid leads on our whereabouts."Good luck with whatever you decide to do, Captain."pSeemingly before you land you are surrounded by members of the local military garrison, and they escort your prisoners away under strict security.The leader of the contingent politely thanks you for your efforts in securing the criminals and tells you that you can collect your well-earned payment from the offices of your Guild.You are met by Techerakh whose eyes widen a fraction at the extent of the claw marks on your body."You have killed your first Cunjo?" he asks respectfully after a quick visual analysis.You nod weakly as you stumble down your ramp."You have its head?" he asks a little more formally.You give him directions to the hold before asking to be excused to look for some medical help.  He immediately calls over two warriors telling them to carry you to the nearest hospital.Over the next few days you float in and out of consciousness as the Heraan doctors pump obscene amounts of drugs into your system to combat the infections caused by the Cunjo's claws.  In your less lucid moments you see the stylized heron rising from Techerakh's face before turning all black and attacking you.  Time and again it attacks you, getting stronger and stronger until the morning you return to full consciousness.After a few more days of rest and meditation, the medical staff pronounce you fit enough to leave the hospital.Bindi fills your ears with pleasant banter as you pilot your craft down to the landing platforms of the arcology that houses the new Chapter House.  You feel like you have known this pleasant young woman for years, not just a few weeks.However, you still get that feeling that she is trying to find out as much about you as possible, almost as if she is trying to figure out how best to handle you.  You realize that this bubbly young lady is a very effective operator, if only because she is capable of hiding her true abilities behind a screen of pleasantries and youthful exuberance.You remind yourself for the thousandth time on this trip to watch yourself around her.You land as close to the central stem of the arcology as you possibly can, calling for medical help for your prisoner as you recklessly plummet down through Aurora's atmosphere.As soon as you touch down you throw your post-flight routine out the window and immediately get the severely injured Kaniuhk out to the waiting medical teams as quickly as possible.After watching the men depart, you notice several Auroran warriors standing several meters away observing the proceedings.  Before turning away they all give you a small nod, acknowledging your skill.You nod in return, before heading inside and arguing over the com unit with the Dock Master as to how much the maintenance and repair of your craft is going to cost you.`Seemingly before you land you are surrounded by many of the colorful Auroran warriors garrisoned here, and they escort your prisoners away under strict security.The commander of the Auroran squad salutes you in acknowledgment of the skill shown in securing the criminals before turning away and rejoining his men.iSeemingly before you land you are surrounded by many of the colorful Auroran warriors garrisoned here, and they escort your prisoners away under strict security.The commander of the Auroran squad nods to you in acknowledgment of the skill shown in capturing these Federation scum before turning away and rejoining his men.*As you pilot into the now-familiar docking bays, your mind wanders over the events of the past few weeks.  In retrospect you can see why the Polaris were dismissive; they really don't need anything the Guild can offer.  There seemed to be no poverty or crime amongst the Polaris, and if any of the readings coming from the Polaris ships were even vaguely accurate then you can see why nobody bothers them.Going through your post-flight routine you mull over what to say in your debrief, as you doubt that the Guild hierarchy, whoever that is, will be overly happy with your report.As you finish up you straighten your shoulders, look sky-ward for a second and stride off to tell the Guild what they don't want to hear.You are surprised to see both Folstam and Corrin in the office when you enter.  They both look up as you enter."So tell me about the Polaris," says Corrin cheerfully.You look over at the more serious Folstam and shake your head.  Corrin drops the smile and, in a business-like motion, locks the doors.As you pilot your way into one of the Kane Bands countless docking bays Gareth Drisbon continually hurls various forms of abuse at you.  Eventually his tirades set your teeth on edge and you give a cold look over your shoulder."Remember the second rule," you state icily.  He immediately subsides.You open your hatch to see the waiting Jack Folstam who looks pleased to see you bring in the traitorous Drisbon."Well," he drawls in a sugary tone, "if it isn't my old friend Gareth."He turns more serious."Forget some of the rules, did we?" he asks sarcastically.  "Perhaps you should learn what happens to those who bite the hand that feeds them."Folstam turns to you and thanks you for your extraordinary service before telling you to see Corrin in the main office to get a suitable reward.  He turns back to Drisbon."Come on, you snake," he hisses angrily.  "You and I have much to discuss."With that he frog marches the prisoner off to some dark hidey-hole to exact the Guilds' revenge.+You quickly make your way to the Guild offices keeping clear of all Federation personnel on your way there.  As soon as you walk in the door Corrin shuts up shop and Folstam walks out from the back room."What did they have for us?" asks Jack and you hand over the data crystal explaining the events that went along with it."Dr. Oriallo Pentecost is alive?" exclaims Corrin, a look of utter surprise on her face.  "He did so much for Port Kane when he was representing them.  More Councillors should be like him.  Hasn't the Bureau officially declared him dead?""Yes," replies Jack absent-mindedly as she scans the information in the crystal, "the Bureau have been using that to discredit the rebels for years now.  Interesting, isn't it?"Folstam drags himself away from the data and turns to you."It's going to take a while to analyze all this," he explains.  "I'll probably need your help when I figure it all out.  When I do I'll find you.  In the mean time I have to find somebody to help me decrypt this damn thing!"After going through your post-flight routine you head off to find the offices for the Guild of Bounty Hunters.  After a bewildering half-hour you eventually find it in one of the many promenades that dot the Kane Band.  The officious receptionist greets you, and after seeing your external camera shots of the action, pays you 10000 credits.She explains to you that this is the only place where you can collect your bounties.  She adds that you will only receive bounties if you have a clean record with the Federation.  She goes on to explain that there are two Guild rules that must be obeyed.  Firstly, the Guild takes ten percent of all bounties received and secondly, never attack another bounty hunter on pain of Guild retaliation.You go through your post-landing routine and then walk to the Guild offices to collect you payment.  The receptionist gives you a warm smile and transfers 22500 credits into your account.Upon landing you are more than happy to open the hatch so that your passengers can get to work.  One glance outside and they turn back to you, terrified.  You lean over to see ten savagely tattooed men holding various bladed weapons waiting not ten feet away.  You realize that the Aurorans aren't finished testing you yet, so you step out drawing your blaster.  One of them charges and you calmly step sideways, your arm in motion .  You slam your forearm down onto the warriors neck.  He collapses to the ground, poleaxed.  The rest grin and another steps forward, lowering his weapons."I am Gurackh Dechtakar," he says simply.  "Know that we have accepted your proposal and we have recognized your skill in travelling here.  So we will destroy your criminal records so that you can operate here safely," he concludes respectfully.  "Meet us in the bar and we shall talk more."You stand, momentarily surprised, before nodding and turning back to your ship."Well, that was easy," comments one of your passengers.You give him a long quiet look before shaking your head and heading off to have a few drinks.!With a sigh you finally land in one of the Kane Band's countless docking bays, and you immediately begin your post-flight routine.  When everything is finished you lead your passengers to the Guild offices to pass on the news.As soon as you walk in your three passengers start telling stories about the voyage.  You have to look skyward when you hear them say that it was their idea to get you to deal with the Auroran warriors.  Noting your reaction, the receptionist comes over and takes you aside."Ignore them," she intones quietly, "they have no real standing in the Guild.  I will make sure that the Day-Master is aware of your work and I am sure she will be pleased."She continues in a louder voice, "Now, in payment for your efforts in this mission the Guild has decided to give you a bonus of 50000 credits ," she grins, "and the Guild will now make available some of the higher-paying and more difficult bounties.  To collect, bring them here and ask for Corrin, and I can assure you I won't be far away."After going through your post-landing routine you head off to the Guild office to collect your payment.  You walk in and Corrin greets you with a warm smile."Another successful hunt I see," she congratulates.  "Good work, the Day-Master will be pleased."She demands you tell her everything that happened, and after hearing the entire story with only a few minor embellishments she looks impressed and transfers your payment of 45000 credits into your account./Outside the hospital, you are met by Techerakh.  He motions you to silence and indicates that you should follow.  You recognize the route he takes and it is no surprise when he takes you back to the room where your training began.What does surprise you is the presence of Kuron, the Mundokiir of the Heraan House.  It is unheard of that the two leading warriors figures of the house, being the Mundokiir who leads the warriors into battle and the Thurokiir who keeps the warriors on the path, are both present at the induction of any warrior.Kuron walks over, and formally asks what symbolizes death to you."A black heron," you reply without thinking.Both Kuron and Techerakh look surprised, but nonetheless Kuron uses his laser burner to quickly draw the design of a heron onto your chest."Now as you wear it close to your heart, death has no power over you," he tells you seriously.  "And with that, you are a warrior," he chuckles."Now get out, but keep checking the bar, we will have need of your special talents soon.""Well, thanks for the lift," says Bindi gratefully as she exits your ship.  "If you want to find out more about the bounty that the Aurorans have for you, it should be in the Mission BBS."She shifts her weight, striking a seemingly girlish pose."Oh, well," she sighs, "I guess I'll see you when you come back this way to collect your pay."She looks down at her shoes, suddenly nervous."{G"Make sure you take care of yourself" "I've never met anyone like you"}," she says {G"shyly" "with a strange admiration in her eyes"}.  "{G"It would be a shame if anything were to happen to you" "Maybe one day I will have my own ship and travel the universe like you"}."In a sudden motion she leans over and gives you a {G"quick peck on the cheek" "admiring hug"} before giving you an embarrassed smile and hurriedly walking away.You stand, a little stunned, and remind yourself once again to pay very careful attention to that girl.  She suddenly got that much more dangerous{G"." " as you are somewhat unsure about how to deal with the hero-worship she so obviously has towards you.  After standing there stunned for a few moments, you shake your head and head back onboard your ship."}You breathe a heavy sigh of relief as you manage to get your beloved <PSN> down in one piece.  You quickly unstrap and go through a very abbreviated post-flight routine so that you can get out of here and after this guy Kaniuhk as soon as possible.  In all likelihood, he already knows that you are here, and is probably crawling down some hole somewhere just to make your life difficult.Soon enough you are standing outside your ship smelling the metallic odor of recycled air trying to remind yourself why you like your work.  Pushing those negative thoughts aside, you head off to the bar to start your search.After taking care of your ship you head off for what your insides tell you is the most {G"dangerous" "trying"} part of your mission - returning to face Bindi.As soon as you set foot in the Guild Offices she almost pounces on you and asks question after question after question trying to find out everything that happened.  Eventually you manage to tell her pretty much everything, {G"only to have her scold you for being careless about running through the rear door of the bar" "all the while her shining, adoring eyes drink it all in"}."You {G"could have been killed" "are the bravest woman in the whole universe"}!" she exclaims.  "{G"We can't have good people like you taking stupid risks with their lives just for a little money" "Maybe one day I can get enough money together to get out of this office and own my own ship and travel the galaxy and do some of the things you have done"}."At that you jump at the chance to change the subject and ask her when you can pick up your pay.  She looks at you {G"askance" "admiringly"} and without saying a word hands over a credit chip.You thank her profusely {G"only to have her admonish you to 'take more care next time'" "and make your getaway as quickly as you can"}.BYou go through your post-landing routine before nervously walking to the Guild offices to collect you payment.  Bindi flashes you a warm smile upon seeing you and spends slightly more than the next hour asking you about everything you have done since you last came by before reluctantly giving you your money and allowing you to leave.{G"The ease at which she can make you comfortable in her presence bothers you, and you remind yourself as soon as you get out of the office to watch yourself around her" "The worship you see in her eyes every time you walk into the room is both embarrassing and disarming at the same time.  Strangely enough for you, you have no idea how to deal with this sort of behavior, and every time you manage to get away from young Bindi you breathe a sigh of relief"}.#As she sits back down you quickly outline the events of your mission.  You are met with a long silence when you finish."I take it you're starting to get a few ideas about my status in the Guild," Folstam begins quietly after the pause.  You nod."Although I doubt that you have actually guessed the particulars," he indicates Corrin.  "Corrin here is the Day-Master."Your eyes widen slightly.Corrin chuckles, "Well, the Day-Master's job is to take care of the day-to-day running of the Guild," she ruminates happily, "and I'm in the perfect position for that.  The role of the Night-Master is to be ready to handle any extraordinary situations that arise."You turn to Jack and he nods.  "Yep," he agrees, "that's me."I've been using you to help me deal with a great number of new situations as I've learned to trust you more and more," he continues.  "Don't worry about this negative report, we can't win them all."Keep an eye out though, I have a few more things coming up soon that I'll need your help with."After taking care of your ship you head off to talk to Corrin about getting your reward for this nasty piece of Guild business.She is actually dealing with another Guild member claiming a bounty when you walk in.  As soon as she sees you she stops her banter with the man and pays him his money before coming over to you."You keep impressing," she says seriously.  "We have had a few problems dealing with renegade bounty hunters over the last few years, and up until now Jack couldn't trust anybody else to take care of them.  That's what he has been grooming you from the time you joined."Corrin looks around and leans a little closer before whispering conspiratorially, "Actually, I suspect he might be thinking of retiring soon," she winks stepping back arching her eyebrows.  "Guess who would be next in line?"Keep checking the mission BBS's," Corrin continues, "and if anything like this comes up again I'll post it for you.  In the mean time, here's 250000 credits for your efforts.  Have fun!"You are greeted by a grim smile from Corrin as you enter the office."Thanks for that," she says seriously.  "That traitor has been bothering our people for months now."You are a little surprised at the heat in the voice of the normally congenial Day-Master.She chats with you for a while catching up on the gossip since you were last in before transferring the money into your account and sending you on your way.After Jack says his goodbyes you and Corrin are left alone."Well that got him interested" she says cryptically.  You give her a questioning look."Remember what I said about him retiring?" Corrin asks and you nod.  "I think that that's going to be postponed for a while now that he has something new in his sights."He's been moping about for a couple of years now," she explains, "going over the same old stuff day in and day out.  He became the Night-Master because he always loved a challenge, and so the extraordinary nature of the job suited him down to the ground.  But eventually he had seen and dealt with just about everything and he was getting bored.  He looks as though he could get his teeth into this though."Corrin punches up a credit transfer."I've transferred over 250000 credits," she continues, "I think it's worth it considering the dangerous political nature of the mission and the fact that you have done something that has brought Jack back into the fold.  Enjoy!"You are met by a slightly suspicious rebel dockmaster who inquires why you have returned.  You explain the circumstances of the death of your friend, and what happened to the Guild.  You don't go into detail, your emotions won't allow you.The dockmaster understands, telling you that any number of rebels have similar pasts.  He tells you that you are lucky to be alive, although your own resourcefulness helped.  Normally the Bureau stops at nothing to achieve its own ends."We always have a need for freighter captains," he explains, you nod in agreement with the implied level of security, "and you can do that without actually gaining a lot of our secrets.  If you were planning on doing something more dangerous, you are going to have to prove yourself first."Go and see the dockmaster on Merrol in the Aldebaran system while he is off-duty in the bar and give him this," he hands you a data crystal.  "He should be able to find something for you.""I am disappointed," he says despondently, "I had been looking forward to our joust.  Perhaps another time."You watch him leave with a sour taste in your mouth, wishing you had done him the honor of facing him."I am surprised," he looks at you, obviously disappointed.  "I had thought you stronger than this.  Perhaps another time."You watch him leave with a sour taste in your mouth, wishing you had taken him on."As I thought," he grins insolently, "your weakness betrays you.  Still, I expected little more."You watch him leave with a sour taste in your mouth, wishing you had taken him on, if only to shut him up.k"Then I suggest you get out of my sight.  I had higher hopes for you."=The faces of the scientists fall, but they nod, understanding your point of view."Well, the Thunderforges will be made available in shipyards throughout Heraan space as they are built," says their spokesman.  "In the mean time we will try to get as many into service as we can."v"I guess that some things are best learned first hand," he grins knowingly before reaching out and shaking your hand again.  "Well, regardless {G"m'boy" "m'dear"}, I wish you all the best in your travels.  Somehow I get the feeling that you will do something that will shake the universe."With a wink he heads off to find another ship."What a spineless dog!  If I had time I'd see you dead where you sit."  His gaze chills your blood, as he turns and walks away.vHe sneers.  "Your safety is compromised.  Beware!"  You shudder as he walks away."I see that my trust has been misplaced.  Watch your back, filth, for I have marked you, and your coward's features, for my revenge.""You know too much now.  We cannot let you live.  Some day soon ..."  He turns and stalks from the bar."So, you refuse the test.  I deem you unfit ever to serve this House.  You have insulted us at our own hearth.  You will be lucky to leave this system alive.""Some people never come out from behind their mothers' skirts!  If I had time I'd see you dead where you sit."  His gaze chills your blood, as he turns and walks away."I understand," Barry nods, smiling quietly, "you want to get out there and do this all on your own without some old fogey hanging off your back.  Still, I'm holding you to the original agreement of a lift to Dunroamin in the Journey's End system."Hune looks at you with a disappointed expression in his face."I thought you were made of sterner stuff," he informs you quietly standing up.With that he walks away, his entire attitude showing his disdain for you.As you centre yourself in the universe, almost absent-mindedly you set a course for the Neilha Memorial Station in the Neilha system to begin the destruction of the Auroran war-machine...As soon as you shake your head, you see an almost imperceptible smile of sheer joy cross his face before he turns even more serious than before and leans forward.<you had better leave federation space as soon as possible>You look around for a moment to see who spoke to you before you realise that the words were spoken inside your own head."I have never been to Auroran space myself," the Vell-os grins subtly, "but I hear it is a land of opportunity where a resourceful {G "man" "woman"} can go far..."As he walks away, you are left feeling like he was trying to tell you something.  And when you see black Federation stormtroopers obviously heading in your direction, you decide that the best place to try and figure it out would be somewhere else...You tell Skinny that Dan is a friend of yours, and that you'd just as soon go without the upgrades than sell out your friend.Skinny sneers, and tells you to "Git offa his land", and you turn and head back to the ship.  The gruesome foursome follow you every step of the way, and Skinny comes behind them, telling you that you had better not hang around.  He and the boys are expecting the rest of their 'kin' back from raiding soon, and they would take great delight in killing you.At least that is what you think he said.However, you believe that the Boys will be going for a joyride soon, and will be gone at least a couple of days.  If you LOOK like you are going, then maybe you can come back and force Skinny to do the repairs for free."Well," drawls Rodney quietly, "I guess we know just how much we can trust you.  Thanks for your efforts.""You disappoint me young'un," Olaf's voice is naught but a whisper.  "I thought there was more to the cut o' yer jib than that."You have just a moment to see a tear form before the big man turns and stalks away from you.You point out to Styles just what you think of him, his clothes and his offer of a job.  It could have been said in just two short words, but you decided to tell him exactly how you feel."Whoa!"  Styles throws his hands up "No need for you to show me the attitude.  Just thought I'd offer you a job, {G"man" "dude"}.  Never thought I'd have to come down here to be hassled by some badly dressed space-{G"jock" "chick"}!""Debris Field are the hottest band around at the moment.  Listen!"  Styles waves to the Juke-bot. "That's pure genius!".You tell him just what you think of the garbage playing on the bot and tell him to leave you alone."No way," you tell Jerry. "I'm not going anywhere near Kontik, too many people disappear out there."Jerry looks disappointed, as do his companions, but what can you say?  No amount of money would get you going anywhere near that place.4You tell Shard that this isn't your bag.  He nods, telling you that if you tell anyone, he will have the Federal Government put a bounty on your head and have you hunted down."No one is going to jeopardize my mission," he says, before turning and stalking from the bar.You send Shard a message saying that you have had some 'engine problems' and that you are unable to continue your mission.  You wait for his reply.  He sends back "Understood, keep quiet or it's your head."  You think about threats, idle or otherwise.  You decide that coming from Temmin Shard, you will take it seriously, and keep your mouth shut."No thanks," you say "I'm not keen on having parts of my body ripped off."Charengo laughs, says that he doesn't blame you, and politely tells you goodnight.  He has to find a pilot, and without another word heads off to another table, and begins talking to another ship captain.  Silently, you wish him luck - you have a feeling that he's going to need it.	The hefty man turns to you with a look of anguish, and for a second you think that he is going to cry, or hit you, or both.  He hauls himself to his feet, and he walks away without a look back at you.  You feel heartily ashamed.~You explain to Michaleen that while you have had the best time possible, but you really have to get back to work trying to make your fortune.  He nods slowly, obviously more than a little disappointed, but he soon lifts his head when he realizes that you have to have a send off.  Next day you leave with a heavy head, and an even heavier heart."I'm sorry that you feel that way <PN>, I thought you were braver than that.  Oh well, this sort of life isn't for everyone..."K"No worries," Flannigan nods quietly, "I was kind of hoping you would volunteer to head down to the Aurorans, as I want you to meet some of my battle brothers.  Meet me in the bar here in a few weeks after I have had a chance to send word to them, and we'll talk about what I want you to do..."While you know that you are as brave as the next freighter captain, you have no intention of putting yourself deliberately in the reach of McGowan and his goons without any backup."Fair enough," mutters Flannigan, obviously disappointed.  He turns to a grim Michaleen and hands him the data-cube.  "It's up to you Mic.  Good luck."They shake hands like warriors, and both head off, conspicuously ignoring you."I understand," Flannigan nods quietly.  "After what McGowan did to you, nobody would want to represent us on a diplomatic mission again.  I wish you well <PN>.""No thanks," you say "I'm not keen on having parts of my body ripped off."Charengo laughs, says that he doesn't blame you, and politely tells you goodnight.  He has to find a pilot, and without another word heads off to another table, and begins talking to another ship captain.  Silently, you wish him luck, you have a feeling that he's going to need it.You take your time going through your post-flight routine, knowing that your opponent will be waiting for you outside.  When you finish, you head out to meet him."I am honored," says the young Heraan warrior seriously, "to have been allowed to prove myself against a worthy opponent such as yourself.  May we meet in combat again sometime in the future.  Hopefully I will put up as good a fight as I did today.""Indeed," you allow in return, "but it will always remain difficult to defeat a warrior as capable as yourself."The young warrior stares at you thoughtfully for a moment before nodding and quietly walking away.OYou take your time going through your post-flight routine, knowing that your opponent will be waiting for you outside.  When you finish, you head out to meet him."Well you were brave," allows the young Tekel warrior seriously, "but you need to work a little more on your combat skills before you will be taken seriously in Auroran space.""Indeed," you allow in return, "but it will always remain difficult to defeat a warrior as capable as yourself."The young warrior stares at you thoughtfully for a moment before nodding and quietly walking away.0You take your time going through your post-flight routine, knowing that your opponent will be waiting for you outside.  When you finish, you head out to meet him."Well you were brave," crows the young warrior as a grinning crowd of his compatriots looks on, "it's a pity your capabilities weren't as great as your bravery.""Obviously," you drawl in return, "they don't teach you Aurorans how to be gracious in victory."The young warrior stares at you thoughtfully for a moment before nodding and quietly walking away._These passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system.[This P'aedt wants to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system.\This Ver'ash wants to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system.]This Tre'pira wants to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system.]This Kel'ariy wants to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system.\This Mu'hari wants to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system.YTake <CQ> tons of <CT> to <DST> in the <DSY> system.`Get <CQ> tons of <CT> to <DST> in the <DSY> system by <DL>.`Get <CQ> tons of <CT> to <DST> in the <DSY> system by <DL>.These passengers need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system and are interested in experiencing flying in a Vell-os craft.uThe representative for the Wild Geese needs to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system.[These rebels need to get to <DST> in the <DSY> system.A group of dockworkers watch as you slide down onto the landing pad and dissolve your javelin shell and then carefully lower your cargo of <CT> to the ground.

They quickly pay you the 5000 credits leaving you to ponder the general level of happiness of the rebels who live and work outside of Federation controlled space.Your passengers depart your ship after paying you the 5000 credits, and soon disappear into the masses filling the poor section of the spaceport.jThe passengers are left a little bug-eyed when you dissolve your protective shielding leaving them standing on the dock.  They pay you the fee of 15,000 credits and walk away talking animatedly amongst themselves.  You smile, sensing that they are heading to the local bar to spread stories of their time on a Vell-os 'ship'.As your passengers step off your ship after paying you the 5000 credits they are warmly welcomed by the Heraan dockworkers who are working on your ship.  You guess that this has something to do with the general friendliness of the Heraan House as compared to the other major Families and it could also reflect on the relationship between them and the citizens of Rimerta."Another day, another call for the Wild Geese," your passenger sighs in his musical accent.  "Oh well, can't complain, it pays the bills."After paying you the agreed-upon fee, he wanders off in search of his contact.+"Zed Flagstaff wins in a blinder of a finish... whoa!  What happened to Bronco Jones in the Green Viper?  What a corker!  That'll go straight into the GRN 'Highlight Holos(tm)'.  Remember, you can order them from any of our stores or hyperload them off the Net."Race 1.mov]"Delores Reitz, the solid workhorse of the GRN League, has crossed the line narrowly ahead of Geordie Wills and Happer Marist in second and third respectively.  Delores has been looking strong in the pre-season warm ups this year, so this win isn't a huge surprise.  With the work she's put in, she deserves it!"Race 2.mov"Freddy Bard is celebrating his win with his usual flair!  He really loves to win a close race, and poor Stevie Lemmet will be disappointed to be edged out at the final gate.  Good job Freddy, keep on smiling!"Race 3.movS"Once again Olar Grymswiler shows us why he's at the top of the GRN Pilot List year after year.  Don't let his gray locks fool you; even though he was winning races when most of the field were still playing at Racing Pilots, he still dices with the best of them!  Can't be unhappy with that one, Olar!"Race 4.mov[Welcome to the Galactic Racing Network, GRN(tm)!You're looking at the future of racing; high speed, high danger and high excitement!  The vehicles you'll be seeing today are superpowered racing Vipers, the quickest and most nimble ships in known space.  Piloted by supremely talented individuals from all corners of the galaxy, these Vipers always put on a good show!You'll have four colors to choose from: Red, Yellow, Blue, and Green.  To place a 1,000 credit bet, all you need to do is click on the racing Viper of your choice.  You'll then watch the race as it finishes to see if your Viper came in first!  If you win, a cool 4,000 credits will be deposited in your account.Once a race has been run, you can see a new race by clicking on any of the Viper colors to reset the game.Best of luck, and good racing!ATMOS would like to thank Ambrosia, Apple, NewTek, Adobe, New Magic, Bungie, techno in general, lots more music we can't think of right now, and last but not least, Haagen, Cascade, Boags, Carlton & United Breweries and Boofhead Mullet Draught.ATMOS offers very special thanks to Bur'chee of the Cold Death (Matthew C. Burch) for his friendship, gifts, time and patience.  Beer is not enough to thank you, but it's all we have! ;) We really hope this is now the game you always wanted to make, Matt.ATMOS offers very special thanks to Andrew Welch for hitting Dave over the head, being an unreadable internet entity and his tall stories of four wheel driving, wine and women.  We would also like to thank him for the foundation and ideas that went into the ATMOS_LASIK technology as it now appears in Nova.ATMOS offers very special thanks to the Sutherland family (including Ralph's father, Mr. Slater), for their tireless efforts towards the project.  It wouldn't be as clean, concise or as well executed without them.  ATMOS particularly wants to thank Dr. Ralph Sutherland for his incredible suite of NovaTools, the half of which the world will never actually see, because they're far too dangerous. :DOh, and Eddie's Green Sauce. :DFun is fun![-] Paul Pentecost:We asked DalSoth if he had anyone to thank, and he said "no."[-] Dafydd Williams:pipeline would like to thank Cathryn for more reasons than can be listed here.  His parents, for being awesome.  He would also like to thank some really daggy music that noone else likes.  The guys who did Babylon 5 don't suck.  The LightWave mailing list rules.  Dave would like to thank Phil for Barnaby and Farquar (for reasons of a personal nature).He has many more things/people to thank, but can't remember them all.  You all rule.[-] Luke Smart:I'd like to take this little piece of a huge game to give you my personal thanks and wishes.  Firstly, I would like to thank my wife, Lisa, who has been a source of strength for me throughout the long years that we have been working on Nova.  She makes every day a dream come true, and without her I know that I wouldn't be writing this message.  When times were hard, she made them easier, and there is no other way to put it.  Next I would like to thank the other half of my waking life, the guys from ATMOS.  I saw more of them in the first twelve months of marriage than I saw of my wife!  Seeing anybody that much can be very hard, and I know that we have all had our ups and downs.  I also know that they make this the best job I have ever had, and their part in my life cannot be measured in terms of just friendship.  The ATMOS family have been there for me, through sickness and health, and I want to thank them from the bottom of my heart for keeping the faith and producing the huge volume of work that is EV Nova.  Andrew Welch makes me smile more than he makes me frown, and despite the fact there have been times I have taken his name in vain, I know that the game that he pushed us to make is far better than any product we could have made without his input.  Matt Burch is a true code warrior, and he deserves huge amounts of praise for basically re-writing the code for Escape Velocity so that we could make Nova.  He also knows lots about beer.  Working and talking to him is a joy, and his message bank message always makes me smile.  Lastly, I would like to thank Mike and Liz Williams.  We have taken over rooms of their house, huge amounts of fridge space with beer, and hardly ever cleaned up after ourselves.  Their home has been our office, and their willingness to take us in and house the rowdy bunch of blokes that make up ATMOS has been a blessing.  The Boofhead Office takes up much of their own home, and I thank them for putting up with us.  Enjoy Nova, and remember, 24 beers in a carton, 24 hours in a day...coincidence, I don't bloody think so![-] Jason Cook:CPL Ken Erlenbusch, who tragically took his own life on the 29th of Feb 2000 not 30 meters from where I stood.My wife Angela, who patiently puts up with my never-ending late nights (and late mornings), and my comings and goings at all kinds of hours.[-] Stephen Chick:Kristy Anthony, for her ideas, help, tolerance and love.Heavy Metal, for keeping me sane(ish).Techno, for making me jump.Sector 9 and Think, for making me move.MP3, for hiding my CDs.Forge & Anvil, for showing us that making games can be fun.[-] Scott Vardy:"What have I done?!"It seems it must have been before the dawn of time now; that I was playing a popular little game called Escape Velocity and thought...  'Hmmm.  A Leviathan would be really nice for this game."  Well, four years later that ship is now called the Pegasus (yes, it really all started with that dumpy little spinning thing) and EV Nova has taken on a life and civilisation of its own. I would like to thank everyone in the ATMOS team for all of their precious time and blood in building concrete bridges from my fairyfloss flights of fervourous fantasy.  Thanks Dave for patiently re-engineering so many of my Scotty-munted ships (aren't polygons hard task masters?).  Thank you, Gail, for the company. Thanks, guys, for actually picking up and running with so much of the weird stuff I came up with in my creative stupour (pity about the TCTLIDS).  I would also like to personaly thank "Coca Cola" as I wouldn't drink Haagen, Cascade, Boags or any other of those forms of bottled piss.I'm looking forward to playing my game.[-] Philip Chick:Phil would like to thank champ for his handbags, and his parents for the hardware and software required for the project.[-] Matt Burch:If there's one person in the world to whom I owe immense thanks for making my portion of Nova possible, it's my wife Mary. Without her constant love and support I would not have been able to pull off this massive piece of work and still hold on to all my marbles. For over a year and a half she has been my source of inspiration, tirelessly putting up with an near-infinite series of late nights and long weekends. Without her, there would be no Nova game engine.I'd also like to thank my parents for equipping me at a young age with the proper set of tools necessary to undertake and complete a project of this scope, and my brother for being a great sounding board for all these years.Finally, I'd like to thank all of ATMOS, the friends I've never met. Guys, I'm really proud to have been able to help bring your universe to life.----------"Never let reality get in the way of a good story."           - Dr. Ralph
